However, most modern buttermilk is cultured. It is common in warm climates (including the Balkans, South Asia, the Middle East and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly. Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making Soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, which the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat."	1662542454504		1a7e179d83935375	wikipedia	Buttermilk	Buttermilk	e7a55e4bd874a19c	"Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink.

Butter is made by agitating cream resulting in clumps of fat and a milky white liquid that contains nearly no fat and some protein. If the cream was soured before (either by aging or by inoculating the cream with lactobacillae), the buttermilk will also be sour. If the butter was made from unfermented cream, the buttermilk will be mild. Uncultured buttermilk is rarely sold, even if butter is made commercially with regular cream, the resulting buttermilk is soured afterwards. As buttermilk is made from a fraction of whole milk (the cream), you could say it’s a part of soured milk. I outlined the process of butter making in this answer, that should also help understanding buttermilk."	1662542815659		4e0e105e0fca7b26	stackExchangeCooking	Is buttermilk another term for sour milk or some part of sour milk?

Answer 3	e1293fe7e347801f	"Depending on what your original recipe is and what your tastebuds like, you could use any mild green herb although the character of the dish would be different: basil and dill do not taste like parsley.Parsley is not 'just a garnish'! Many dishes, like tabbouli, absolutely rely on parsley. Parsley has its own flavor and texture (as you guessed when you said, ""there must be something about the taste otherwise it would call for parsley within the sauce as well"").If your recipe calls for fresh parsley, you will want to use fresh parsley, or fresh something else in its place. Dried herbs cannot give the same vivacity."	1662722362369	alternative to parsley	1662722267692		2d55e7cd3d3bee76	seriousEats	Barbecue Sides: German Potato Salad	Barbecue Sides: German Potato Salad	c028db7edf5ba1a6	"For this recipe, I like to use a waxy variety of potatoes rather than starchy since they hold their shape better when mixed with the bacon, sautéed onions, vinegar, and mustard. Traditionally it's finished with a dose of parsley, but because I find too much parsley starts to overpower and taste a little bitter, I add a mixture of parsley and chives to give the right amount of freshness with a bonus light oniony flavor."	1662722420673

-N5k3j_gNKx8KLpwQPou	5	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"If you've ever carved a roast chicken or turkey before, then you've got nothing to worry about, because cutting the meat off a duck crown is the same as carving the breasts of any roast bird. And even if you haven't done much carving in your life, don't sweat it; it's easy. The most important thing you need to do in terms of carving happens before the duck even goes in the oven—removing the wishbone. As I mentioned in the primer for dry-aging ducks, I like to remove the wishbone after the birds have finished aging in the fridge. The skin and flesh around the neck cavity dry out during the aging process, making it easier to locate and cut out the wishbone cleanly, without taking a chunk of breast meat with it. Once the crown is roasted and rested, carving the breasts off the cage is pretty simple. Use a sharp knife, preferably a slicer with a long thin blade that allows you to cut with smooth even strokes. Slice into the breast on one side of the breastbone and use steady, smooth knife strokes, riding the contour of the breastbone with the blade and gently pulling the breast back with your off-hand as you cut. The breast will gradually pull away from the cage, and you can cut it away completely at the point where it connects with the shoulder joint. Remove the second breast and then set aside the crown carcass for making another batch of duck stock. Take a second to trim up the breasts before slicing and serving. The bottom edge of the breast where it protruded from the crown has very little meat along with some tough cartilage and skin. Place the breasts skin-side-down on your board, trim off those pieces, and discard them. On the upper edge of the breast, you will find a large pocket of fat between the meat and skin. I like to trim that away as well. Now you get to pick your preferred slicing presentation for serving. You can slice the breasts crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces that are ideal for a family-style meal or in half, lengthwise, if you're going for more of a minimalist fine-dining vibe."	1656516442477	5eee9d0844b15e2a	seriousEats	The Best Roast Duck Breast Is Dry-Aged	Keys to Carving	7d948c882b6bb0f1	"If you've ever carved a roast chicken or turkey before, then you've got nothing to worry about, because cutting the meat off a duck crown is the same as carving the breasts of any roast bird.

A ball of well-kneaded cold water dough will spring back if you press it and contract if you stretch it. This is why, for example, pizza dough is extremely hard to roll out until it's had at least a couple hours to rest and allow this gluten to relax. A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.

Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine. Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents. Because the salt has a purer flavor due to the lack of metallic or bitter-tasting additives such as iodine, fluoride or dextrose, it is often used in the kitchen instead of additive-containing table salt, so such flavors are not introduced to prepared food."	1662732122859	9650940d502b01d6	wikipedia	Kosher salt	Kosher salt	f2006367bc3e9d1c	"Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine.

Estimating the amount of salt when salting by hand can also be easier due to the larger grain size. Some recipes specifically call for volume measurement of kosher/kitchen salt, which weighs less per measure due to its lower density and is therefore less salty than an equal volume measurement of table salt. Different brands of different salt vary dramatically; a measure of one brand may be twice as salty as a measure of another."	1662732090832	kosher salt	1662732072208

Answer 1	7c717021435da819	"It is generally recommended to ""blanch"" vegetables before freezing them. Blanching is heating the vegetables (by boiling or steaming) for a specific number of minutes. You typically follow blanching immediately with an ice-water bath, to stop the cooking process. From The National Center for Home Food Preservation: Blanching slows or stops the action of enzymes which cause loss of flavor, color and texture. Blanching cleanses the surface of dirt and organisms, brightens the color and helps retard loss of vitamins. Blanching also wilts or softens vegetables and makes them easier to pack.

Mix and match to your heart's content.  Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy.

It first rises because of the steam created during baking, but once the steam production is over, it deflates. Unlike real cakes, which include flour, there is nothing to create a persistent structure here. There is nothing to prevent a souffle from falling when it has cooled, it is like expecting a punctured baloon to stay inflated. I would suggest using a different recipe. Alternatively, you can decide that you are OK with a moist, fudgy cake without much rise.

Curdling is intentional and desirable in making cheese and tofu; unintentional and undesirable in making sauces and custards. Curdling occurs naturally in cows' milk, if it is left open to air for a few days in a warm environment. Milk is composed of several compounds, primarily fat, protein, and sugar. The protein in milk is normally suspended in a colloidal solution, which means that the small protein molecules float around freely and independently. These floating protein molecules refract light and contribute (with the suspended fat) to the white appearance of milk. Normally these protein molecules repel each other, allowing them to float about without clumping, but when the pH of their solution changes, they can attract one another and form clumps. This is what happens when milk curdles, as the pH drops and becomes more acidic, the protein (casein and others) molecules attract one another and become ""curdles"" floating in a solution of translucent whey.

Answer 1	1ea5567e3df430e1	"Generally, you should use unsalted butter. You can always add salt to your unsalted butter, but you can't take it out if you want it less salty!    If it's just being melted on some vegetables, then salted butter is probably fine. However, different brands of salted butter have different amounts of salt added, which makes it difficult to know how much total salt is going into your food. This is more problematic in baking. It's possible to easily oversalt or undersalt just by using a different brand — leading to unpredictable results. By using unsalted butter, the only salt remaining in the recipe is what you have added, and you have more careful control over the outcome.    If you need to substitute one for another, you can estimate how much salt is in salted butter and adjust your recipe accordingly.        If you are not sure whether a particular recipe calls for salted or unsalted, look for clues.      Is there additional salt in the recipe? (If not, it may expect some salt from the butter. If so, it may expect unsalted butter!)  How old is the recipe? (Newer recipes tend to assume unsalted butter. Older recipes tend to assume salted butter.)  Where was the recipe written? Different cultures assume different butters (and salt levels may vary between countries for salted butter!); I will not give an exhaustive list here, mostly because I don't know, but it's worth researching.      If you have the time, interest, and money, you can try making the recipe twice (once with salted, once with unsalted butter) and see which tastes better. This is a bigger investment, though, so only worth doing if you really want to get the recipe as good as possible."	1660560000000	salted	1660560000000	salted or unsalted butter	1660560000000

Answer 1	26006f69d6ac6f9b	"Self-rising flour is just flour with the addition of baking powder and salt*. So, it doesn't matter whether you use self-rising flour or make your own by combining these ingredients yourself.     * note: not all countries include salt in self-rising flour. There is no salt added in the UK ""self-raising"" mixture for example, but there salt added in the US and Canada.    Because of this, if you live in the US and are using a UK recipe, you will need to omit some or all of the salt in the recipe since self-rising flour already contains salt.     Conversely, if you are living in the UK and following a US recipe, you will need to add salt if using self-raising flour where it calls for self-rising flour.     Otherwise you could end up with no salt or more than you intended. It sounds like in your case your recipe assumes that self-rising flour has salt added.     One of our devoted readers also found that US self-rising flour has less baking powder than UK self-raising flour, raising doubts as to whether additional baking powder may be needed for some recipes.     Note: A good clue will be the spelling of ""self-raising"" vs. ""self-rising"" to determine whether salt is expected in your mix. And Brits also have a lot of other weird spelling, grammar, and nomenclature differences, such as calling desserts ""puddings."" Be cautious when dealing with these people. They are very suspicious.     In the end, I would suggest just using normal flour and adding salt and baking powder yourself. If you are using a recipe that calls for self-raising or self-rising or pulling-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps flour, just find a similar recipe that calls for normal flour to see how much salt and baking powder should be used."	1660560000000	self raising	1660560000000	self raising flour	1660560000000

-NH9xlGpmsRScWAiE9Dt	14	active	text			other	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"Wow, seems that you're already an expert :-) You're right:  First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases.  Breading will help mitigate this effect to a degree by slowing down the transfer of energy to the meat, but a significant amount of squeezing is still going to occur regardless of how well breaded the chicken is. Myosin is one of the key proteins responsible for this squeezing action, so by dissolving it, you prevent a lot of moisture loss from taking place."	1668778759285
-NH9xnQGvYLqleE9K8Nv	14	active	text			other	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. This is the main principle behind sausage making—dissolved proteins can bond with each other, creating a pleasantly bouncy, tender texture. Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading."	1668778768081

Knowing that gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water—is the most likely culprit, you can minimize its formation.  First and foremost: cut the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein.  Replacing a quarter of the flour worked well. Adding a couple teaspoons of baking powder to the mix helped bring a bit of air to the mix, forming a crust that was lighter and crisper, with increased surface area (and we all know that more surface area = more crispness, right?)."	1668780086434

-NHA5vKchainYWoMJhym	14	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"Ok. So breast meat is composed mainly of what are known as fast-twitch muscles—muscles that are rarely used on a day-to-day basis, but are great for quick, powerful bursts of action. Fast-twitch muscle tends to be relatively light in color and low in connective tissue and fat. Leg meat, on the other hand, is mainly slow-twitch muscle. It's used day in and day out as the turkey walks around scratching for food. As a result, it's darker and packed with tough connective tissue. Because the two muscle structures are so massively different, they must be cooked differently to achieve ideal results. Breast meat is best when cooked to no higher than about 150°F-any higher and it dries out. On the other hand, the tough connective tissue in leg meat doesn't get tender until it gets to at least 165°F (74°C) or so."	1668781159784

-NGqBpjCpbTGUE2aQ15E	16	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it.

-NGqBwsiGNdvuvJghYgd	16	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough."	1668430417454

-NGuqNBvM_3Hd8_bfNVB	17	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking. Maceration is the ""magic"" (really science) of applied osmotic pressure. The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher. If water is needed, it would be added after maceration, in those recipes.)"	1668508386107

Add too much more flour, for example, and your soufflé is going to start to resemble a cake; too little and it'll be too thin to hold its shape, spilling up and over the sides of its container. In this recipe the amount of flour in the béchamel is leaning toward the high end of what's generally called for.

-NGvpAYacZ7dKMHLYiBS	18	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"First, the heat of the oven is a critical ""ingredient"" for getting a soufflé to rise; it's what causes gases to expand inside all those trapped air bubbles and what converts moisture in the soufflé batter to steam. Together, those forces expand the air bubbles and cause the soufflé to swell. The hotter the oven, the more quickly and fully the soufflé will rise, and the faster it will brown and set on the outside. The heat also sets the proteins in the egg yolks and whites, allowing the soufflé to keep some of its height even after cooling. Without the eggs setting, the soufflé batter would remain liquid and would immediately collapse back down to its original state as soon as it cooled. Lastly, the heat browns the surface of the soufflé, giving it a deeper flavor, thanks to our good friend the Maillard reaction."	1668524849382

-NGvqY1rho1N0jEtgHLG	18	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic reaction. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the amine group of a free amino acid and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar, usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry, since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor."	1668525207735

-NGvqj5vgV_lEW90GPbh	18	active	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"A 400°F oven produced a marginally taller soufflé than a 375°F oven did.  But the soufflé is also more likely to remain runny in the center, since it'd come close to burning on the outside if you were to leave it long enough to cook through to the center.  If you use a lower oven temperature, like 350°F or 375°F, you'll get slightly less of a rise, and the soufflé will brown on the outside more slowly.  That buys you time to leave the soufflé in the oven longer, letting it cook through more fully to the center with less risk that the surface blackens in the process."	1668525257147

This is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch."	1667903105199

If a bird is to be stuffed, the giblets are traditionally chopped and added to the stuffing; however, the USDA recommends cooking giblets separately from the rest of the bird. If not, they can be used for other purposes, such as ""giblet pie"" or, a Southern U.S. favorite, giblet gravy. With the exception of giblet gravy, the liver is not usually included in these recipes, as its strong flavor tends to overpower other ingredients. It may be used in liver-specific recipes, such as pâté or yakitori. Giblets can also be used to make alicot, a French stew."	1668264851952

-NH4UhaP7Hk9AOoc-mhQ	22	passive	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"This process is called brining.  As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together.   An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.  Brines also improve juiciness by increasing the muscles' ability to retain moisture. In this case, however, a much, much longer brining time was necessary in order to completely mitigate the effects of high-temperature frying, delivering a uniquely smooth, juicy texture to the meat."	1668686993818

However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Interestingly, the Roman cookbook of ""Apicius"" (4th century) has a recipe for deep-fried chicken called ""Pullum Frontonianum"".  The American English expression ""fried chicken"" is first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s."	1668687493504

The mortar-and-pestle pesto coats the noodles beautifully, bathing them in a gorgeous green-tinted sauce. By contrast, the food processor pesto just sticks to the pasta in little bits, like glitter, and the oil absorbs little of the basil's colour."	1672402344628

-NKdCzlTnUqReo3uhVmr	21	active	text			other	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"Well that's fine!  With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it.  A ball of well-kneaded cold water dough will spring back if you press it and contract if you stretch it. This is why, for example, pizza dough is extremely hard to roll out until it's had at least a couple hours to rest and allow this gluten to relax."	1672507554910
-NKdD1vMRvPhk8fQNOcg	21	active	text			other	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces.

-NJis7DFF-M_LBglXT6F	25	passive	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"Pesto  or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together.  During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was ""agliata"", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book ""La Cuciniera Genovese"" in 1863"	1671528743825

In the Levant ground stones appear in Mesolithic 2 (Natufian). In prehistoric Japan, ground stone tools appear during the Japanese Paleolithic, possibly predating adoption elsewhere in the Neolithic by 25,000 years. When mashing up seeds and leaves into powders, rounded and smooth ground stones would be used inside a stone bowl. This pair of tools is called a mortar and pestle. The material would be placed into the mortar and the pestle would be moved and pressed into the mortar to grind the material into a fine powder."	1671529129899

It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb ""souffler"" which means ""to blow"", ""to breathe"", ""to inflate"" or ""to puff"". The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century."	1672569111486

-NKgvqbKOL4dDhnG2Ped	29	passive	text			answer	TRUE	TRUE	agent	"I have to say, there's no single best way to separate an egg. First, though, a few tips: Make sure your hands are scrupulously clean. No matter how you separate your eggs, the yolks and whites are likely to come into contact with your fingers. You don't want to transfer anything germy from your hands to the eggs. No matter what method you use, start by gently cracking the egg against a flat surface, so that you don't get eggshell into the egg. Cold eggs are easier to separate than those at room temperature; the yolk breaks less easily.  Fresh eggs are easier to separate than older ones. After cracking the egg, gently pry the shell halves apart. Let the yolk settle into the bottom half of the shell, allowing the white to run over the shell and into a measuring cup or small bowl. Some white will remain with the yolk, so you can gently transfer the yolk back and forth between the shell, continuing to let the white drip over the shell into the bowl."	1672569907669
