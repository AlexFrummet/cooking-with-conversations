-NAj4XN9DSfVJGltBsix	More than taste whisking will affect the souffle consistency. More precisely, this will trap tiny air bubbles in the beaten whites. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them. That's what causes a soufflé to rise.	5	4	4

-NBMCjOdb6GfW-hu3F-h	Knowing that gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water—is the most likely culprit that leads to a crust with an almost rock-like density.  First and foremost: cut the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein.	5	4	5			
-N6JkvMxhDBz9U6eEf2W	2 tablespoons (30g) pine nuts

-N9kEouthEuUPY0A_fCs	That's a really good question. So does It Matter What Kind of Mortar and Pestle You Use for Pesto? So if you use a ceramic mortar with a narrow ceramic pestle, the results are good, but the sauce never fully emulsifies.  The Thai granite mortar and pestle does a much better job, but it still didn't come close to the effectiveness of the Italian marble mortar with the large wooden pestle.  That large pestle head is perfect for efficiently smashing the garlic to paste, and the pine nuts, too. The basil yields under it in a fraction of the time and breaks down more fully.	7	6	6

-NBM7FvTYVDZufAoNGZo	Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.	3	3	2

-N8YLk3r-ls6YO3J4dyt	until minute 1:40						
-N5tyuP3Xs20PcPaI3s8	So your guess regarding the heat is correct! That's the important thing. In our case, glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie. Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.	8	8	6

-NBHf2BSsMlJyuFm0gNT	This is step 1. Let me know if you have any questions regarding this step.						
-N6Jk7Uk-U9fvWLMJXnB	Mortar and pestle are implements used since ancient times to prepare ingredients or substances by crushing and grinding them into a fine paste or powder in the kitchen, laboratory, and pharmacy. The "mortar"  is a bowl, typically made of hard wood, metal, ceramic, or hard stone, such as granite. The "pestle"  is a heavy and blunt club-shaped object.	8	5	5			
-N5jxcdUP0oIm7MvhIHv	Is there anything else you'd like to learn about this step?						
-N4Mta3KZ6nyw6ql6pLn	Yes precisely. The coating overcooks long before the chicken is cooked through to the center. Hence, just fry the chicken until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace. The result is chicken with a deep brown, craggy crust that's shatteringly crisp but not tough and that breaks away to meat that bursts with intensely seasoned juices underneath.	5	3	3	procedural		
-N5eqR_kc7QFdLzkXy-5	oh wow, that's correct!! You really are an expert!Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution.

-NBXCfeMr5VQPItnZOp_	So speaking of nuts in pesto:Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy.  As a caution, though, you need to get good, fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts, or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid.Almonds could also work, although I'd think they'd be rather bland.  The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper.  Again, freshness and getting the skin off is important. As long as you toast them properly first, they are delicious (though not the same as pine nuts, of course -- not nearly as fatty, for one thing).	10	9	8	procedural		including some procedural

-NBST4EdhYntXXMETtzd	In confectionery and candy making, cream of tartar is commonly used as the acidulant, with typical amounts in the range of 0.15-0.25% of the sugar's weight. The use of cream of tartar imparts a honey-like flavor to the syrup.

-NBHmmck1F9bCXuwjSgq	Actually it's some sort of policy against over-beaten egg whites. You can either use an expensive copper egg-beating bowl, which helps form more stable beaten whites that are less prone to breaking and weeping (the copper interferes with too-strong sulfur bonds from forming). You can add a little cream of tartar to the whites, an acid that also prevents those sulfur bonds from forming.	4	4	4

The name is also used in France in the dish known as "gnocchis à la parisienne", a hot dish comprising gnocchi formed of choux pastry served with Béchamel sauce. A specialty of Nice, the "gnocchi de tantifla a la nissarda", is made with potatoes, wheat flour, eggs and "blette" (Swiss chard), which is also used for the "tourte de blette". "La merda dé can" is longer than the original gnocchi.	8	7	6

-N8YIedYn4hQBnj9yQn2	While it's often said that using a variety of apples can create depth of flavor, this can also introduce unnecessary variables into the equation, with some types breaking down more quickly to flood the pie with juice. When you stick with one type of apple, the pie's consistency stays the same from batch to batch; depth is created through a blend of brown sugar and spices that highlights the apples rather than overwhelming them. For this purpose, I'm a big fan of tart baking apples, like Granny Smiths.	3	5	6

-N5k3j_gNKx8KLpwQPou	If you've ever carved a roast chicken or turkey before, then you've got nothing to worry about, because cutting the meat off a duck crown is the same as carving the breasts of any roast bird. And even if you haven't done much carving in your life, don't sweat it; it's easy. The most important thing you need to do in terms of carving happens before the duck even goes in the oven—removing the wishbone. As I mentioned in the primer for dry-aging ducks, I like to remove the wishbone after the birds have finished aging in the fridge. The skin and flesh around the neck cavity dry out during the aging process, making it easier to locate and cut out the wishbone cleanly, without taking a chunk of breast meat with it. Once the crown is roasted and rested, carving the breasts off the cage is pretty simple. Use a sharp knife, preferably a slicer with a long thin blade that allows you to cut with smooth even strokes. Slice into the breast on one side of the breastbone and use steady, smooth knife strokes, riding the contour of the breastbone with the blade and gently pulling the breast back with your off-hand as you cut. The breast will gradually pull away from the cage, and you can cut it away completely at the point where it connects with the shoulder joint. Remove the second breast and then set aside the crown carcass for making another batch of duck stock. Take a second to trim up the breasts before slicing and serving. The bottom edge of the breast where it protruded from the crown has very little meat along with some tough cartilage and skin. Place the breasts skin-side-down on your board, trim off those pieces, and discard them. On the upper edge of the breast, you will find a large pocket of fat between the meat and skin. I like to trim that away as well. Now you get to pick your preferred slicing presentation for serving. You can slice the breasts crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces that are ideal for a family-style meal or in half, lengthwise, if you're going for more of a minimalist fine-dining vibe.	1	2		procedural	procedural

-NBWwPL_UuSG9c5ffQU1	That's true! hot water dough is easy-to-shape the stretching is easy, and, what's more, the gnocchi keep their stretched-out shape even after they begin to cool, ensuring that they stay light and tender no matter how we choose to finish them off.	3	2	4			
-N5twHxhPHOfNraghQrP	Alright let's go on with step 3:   Add tapioca starch to the apples, reseal, and toss to combine. Pour apple filling into the prepared pie shell, nestling the slices into a flattish mound. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck the dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design). Refrigerate the pie until cold and firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).		0		procedural	procedural	just the step

It has been a traditional type of Italian pasta of (probable) Middle Eastern origin since Roman times. It was introduced by the Roman legions during the expansion of the empire into the countries of the European continent.

-N6Jo-3BrjsTvep78TUB	Pesto or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together. The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the "Appendix Vergiliana", an ancient collection of poems where the author dwells on the details about the preparation of "moretum". During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was "agliata", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book "La Cuciniera Genovese" in 1863:	15	16	11

Then, Avice, in the eighteenth century, created what was then called choux buns. The name of the dough changed to , as Avice's buns resembled cabbages—"choux" in French. This pastry is used to make profiteroles, , éclairs, French crullers, St. Honoré cake, Parisian gnocchi, dumplings and gougères.	7	8	7

-NBN37MPWfXVMhbdmOKQ	A glass pie plate is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.	9	8	6

The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher.

-NBWwj3B2wfvOslLL-w9	By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough. Adding butter and other fats to the dough will further diminish its gluten-forming abilities. If we were to try and make gnocchi with a cold water dough, one with plenty of springy, elastic gluten, we'd have a heck of a time getting those gnocchi hot enough to expand to the point where they come out nice and airy; Instead, we'd end up with dense, chewy nubs that taste more like damp bread.	8	8	8

-N4Mr7l1C7sZUBvsitva	Yes, precisely!  Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution.  As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together).	5	5	5

-N5ttwbbgeGYxrNghA_m	This is step 2:  Measure 50 ounces sliced apples (11 rounded cups; 1.45kg) into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, until the apples have lost a third of their volume, at least 3 hours. The apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.		0		procedural	procedural

-NBXAzdXel2FGl_1UxBl	Historically, the cheeses of true Ligurian pesto were Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Sardo (or Fiore Sardo), a Sardinian sheep's-milk cheese. If you can find the Fiore Sardo, it will make a marginally better pesto sauce, but Pecorino Romano makes a darned good one, too (and, frankly, Parmigiano-Reggiano alone makes a great one as well).	3	3	3			
-NBHNu6wr3AP14l_RYOU	Yes that's part of it. However, this is important because as the gnocchi go through their primary poaching step in simmering water, water vapor and trapped gases will expand, causing the gnocchi to inflate slightly. This change in density caused by expanding gases is what causes them to gently float to the surface of the pot as they poach. If we were to try and make gnocchi with a cold water dough we'd end up with dense, chewy nubs that taste more like damp bread.	6	5	5

-NBM7E1ziBe_CHdaOESy	Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. This is the main principle behind sausage making—dissolved proteins can bond with each other, creating a pleasantly bouncy, tender texture.	4	5	5

Gnocchi ( are a variety of pasta consisting of various thick, small, and soft dough dumplings that may be made from semolina, ordinary wheat flour, egg, cheese, potato, breadcrumbs, cornmeal or similar ingredients, and possibly including flavourings of herbs, vegetables, cocoa or prunes. Parisian gnocchi or  "gnocchis à la parisienne", a hot dish comprising gnocchi formed of choux pastry served with Béchamel sauce is a French variation.	6	6	5			
-NBRrYspACgu2T29B_Ok	Basil is sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the temperate zone, and others in subtropical climates. Although basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.	12	10	14

-NAj3xzFuYsURrXbi6va	That's a great question!  The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose.

-N5k-JRocdsyPCefknx8	Yes that's correct! First, the meat all over is on the darker side, giving it a richer, oilier texture that can better withstand the drying effects of high temperatures. Second, and even more important, is the duck's luxuriously fatty skin, which insulates the meat and bathes it in mouth-coating rendered fat, ensuring each bite is unctuous. You can cook the crap out of a duck and as long as you eat it with the skin, it will never seem dry.	7	6	5

-N5k0q8LrHdd2k1NwoMO	Yes precisely!  To do it, you add water to the sugar first, which wets and dissolves it, speeding up the caramelization process while helping to prevent scorching. The water cooks off as the mixture boils (which, incidentally, you can swirl and stir and otherwise monkey with to ensure even browning, no wet pastry brush needed), and it's clear to the eye when the caramel reaches a nice deep amber color. At this point, you can add the vinegar in very small additions, gently swirling as you do; it will boil and bubble violently, so take your time to avoid a boil-over. Some of the sugar might seize up a bit, but if you keep swirling, it'll dissolve back into the solution quickly.	8	6	5	procedural	procedural	procedural?

Stand in the same position as 1. and with the blade parallel to to your body cut down through the carcass so you have the back and the breast in separate piecesRemove the breast from the bone by sliding the knife (might want to use a smaller knife here) between the meat and the bone.

-NBMF8vcfIrDLphxKlMD	Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. However, most modern buttermilk is cultured. It is common in warm climates (including the Balkans, South Asia, the Middle East and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly. Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making Soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, which the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat.	15	14	12

-NBHNP1RqQ6wwhUu1_07	The main difference is regarding the dough consistency.  A ball of well-kneaded cold water dough will spring back if you press it and contract if you stretch it. This is why, for example, pizza dough is extremely hard to roll out until it's had at least a couple hours to rest and allow this gluten to relax. A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough. As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple, kind of like Play-Do.	13	9	9

-NAEZSDiAaYQGZ0FopO5	Historically, the cheeses of true Ligurian pesto were Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Sardo (or Fiore Sardo), a Sardinian sheep's-milk cheese. When pesto first became popular in the United States, however, Fiore Sardo was pretty much unavailable here, so recipe writers substituted the next best available thing: Pecorino Romano. But Pecorino Romano is saltier, sharper, and tangier than Fiore Sardo. So, if you can find the Fiore Sardo, it will make a marginally better pesto sauce, but Pecorino Romano makes a darned good one, too (and, frankly, Parmigiano-Reggiano alone makes a great one as well).	7	5	5

-N5twzZd1FGssW9Iialr	Good question:  The liquid you see after macerating the apples is a syrup composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. ( The mixture weighs little more than the brown sugar added in step one.) This is more or less the same thing that happens with my fresh lemon syrup, in which dry lemon rinds are tossed with seven ounces of sugar to yield a scant eight ounces of syrup after a few hours. That lack of moisture means there's no need to spend time and energy cooking the liquid down to concentrate the "juices," as the liquid is already quite concentrated in terms of both flavor and water content. Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose, while the overall water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch.	9	6	6		procedural	procedural

-N5jwmCSBLoj4e3Gguj_	Yes exactly! Its origin is actually quite interesting.  The beginning beginning takes us out of France and south to Italy.

-NAJyo7Lej9teUzYxl32	You want to avoid the coating overcooking long before the chicken is cooked through to the center. For this reason, you need to fry the chicken until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace.

If the cream was soured before (either by aging or by inoculating the cream with lactobacillae), the buttermilk will also be sour. If the butter was made from unfermented cream, the buttermilk will be mild.Uncultured buttermilk is rarely sold, even if butter is made commercially with regular cream, the resulting buttermilk is soured afterwards.As buttermilk is made from a fraction of whole milk (the cream), you could say it’s a part of soured milk.

At first, this can actually be an advantage. Less hydrophobic molecules in your oil means that it can come into closer contact with foods, allowing them to fry just a bit more efficiently. However,   as this breakdown continues, your oil becomes less and less hydrophobic, and eventually it'll start entering your food too rapidly, causing it to turn greasy and ruining its crispness.

-NBRppxea_6OjWmVp-Fw	Pine nuts, also called piñón () or pinoli (), sometimes called pignoli in the US, are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus "Pinus"). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines, the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of notable value as a human food. Throughout Europe and Middle East the pine nuts used are traditionally from "Pinus pinea" (stone pine). They are easily distinguished from the Asian pine nuts by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian pine nuts are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations. Pine nuts contain thiamine (vitamin B) and protein.	12	13	13

-N8YNM0f7nvevmXceoz9	An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is, on occasion, served with whipped cream or iced cream (which is known as "apple pie a la mode"), or with cheddar cheese. The pastry part is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a "double-crust pie"; the upper crust may be circular or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). Depending on the baker's preference, the bottom crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent it from getting soggy.	7	7	7

-NBg2RTAF0LkPhaJ8OSw	So Parisian gnocchi are somewhat of an oddity in the Western repertoire, in that they're made with a hot water dough.  The beauty of a hot water dough is that it doesn't bounce back as much as a cold water dough does.  As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple, kind of like Play-Do. With our tender, easy-to-shape hot water dough, however, the stretching is easy, and, what's more, the gnocchi keep their stretched-out shape even after they begin to cool, ensuring that they stay light and tender no matter how we choose to finish them off.	8	6	6

-NBWzn2wHtQHEWBeebQD	It is a flat, rectangular metal pan used in an oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, Swiss rolls and pizzas. Typically, for rimmed trays, each rim will sacrifice 0.5–0.75 inches (1–2 cm) of baking surface along that edge. Pans of a single design from a single vendor will usually share the same rim height and rake across all tray sizes in a series, thus the sacrifice of flat baking surface is proportionally greater (relative to outer dimension) for small pans than for large pans.	7	4	5			
-NAitvWLFCQsP3tocknV	It does not really matter as long as you use a sharp knife. You should use the blade to open each vent a little wider. When vents are cut too narrow, entrapped steam can make the top crust a bit mushy.	2	3	3	procedural		1 procedural

-NAJvweZsJVZ2jMR_3M3	Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution. As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins. As proteins dissolve, three things take place:	3	4	3

-NBXYfffbSt8FPC_YtJ1	That's a great question! And yes there is a reason for using it! Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine. Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents. Because the salt has a purer flavor due to the lack of metallic or bitter-tasting additives such as iodine, fluoride or dextrose, it is often used in the kitchen instead of additive-containing table salt, so such flavors are not introduced to prepared food.	10	7	6

-N6JoYzO8F7LDy7Z8aTF	An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids. Although the terms "colloid" and "emulsion" are sometimes used interchangeably, "emulsion" should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, and some cutting fluids for metal working.	8	6	6

-N8YMhckmuSwZ1tifsa6	An egg wash is often used to make pastries shiny and golden or brown in color, and it also is used to help toppings or coatings stick to the surface of the pastry, or to bind pastry parts together, such as empanadas or other en croute recipes. Egg wash can usually be made with 30 ml or two tablespoons of liquid, such as milk or water, for every egg. Less liquid makes for a darker wash. The part of the egg used and liquid added determines the finished look of the crust.	8	8	6			
-N8YNJG5LAIYs_JdGEIi	An Apple crumble is a dessert of baked chopped apples topped with a crisp streusel crust. In the UK, Australia and New Zealand the term 'crumble' refers to both desserts but in the US and Canada the two are distinguished.

One of the most common variants is "apple rhubarb crisp", in which the rhubarb provides a tart contrast to the apples.	6	6	5

Curdling is intentional and desirable in making cheese and tofu; unintentional and undesirable in making sauces and custards. Curdling occurs naturally in cows' milk, if it is left open to air for a few days in a warm environment.	5	4	4

-N8YO-QlSgMCgAp3HyoK	That's a great question! The type of pan really affects the quality of your pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy.  Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.	8	8	8

-NBSGNs8qJ-KPoizLrg4	A soufflé is a baked egg-based dish which originated in early eighteenth century France. It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert.
