o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM4d-O2nP6qoZ2zi-G	user	26	5	ok, what's the first step?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM4ihrwHLmCiybGdRW	agent	13	3	I'll show you
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM4qPJT1_OQMboWpmm	agent	22	5	Do you see it already?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM4uO8I7-lL_ppa5pr	user	27	5	I don't see anything? sorry
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM4yU-HWgg2zpxsoey	agent	163	29	Alright so this is what you need to do first:Combine the paprika, black pepper, garlic powder, oregano, and cayenne in a small bowl and mix thoroughly with a fork.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM58CSkmlIbQsVMDuu	user	11	2	cool thanks
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM5EpFpY6DZXAdG5sI	agent	54	9	Do you have any questions regarding this initial step?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM5KRGzz_M1hyeDk-t	user	16	4	No, I've done it
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM5S-yZa1DkGIzW50g	agent	24	5	Great! So let's move on.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM5Trr0mPHaWcGOeZb	agent	383	66	Step 2:  Whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a large bowl. Add the chicken pieces and toss and turn to coat. Transfer the contents of the bowl to a gallon-sized zipper-lock freezer bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, and up to overnight, flipping the bag occasionally to redistribute the contents and coat the chicken evenly.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM5tda8V8hUlrTOsWZ	user	44	9	Do I manually whisk or use a mixing machine?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM5xOtldpYKGXMelEg	agent	13	3	Let me see...
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6Pn-LF9psTijFTpR	agent	93	17	I'm sorry, I do not think I have this information. But manual whisking should be enough here.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6TTuP4YX1MgZHPVM	user	36	9	Ok, after the 4 hours, what do I do?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6c-b1o9sI-ts0L-s	agent	95	18	Also be aware of the chemical processes that are going on in this step which is called brining.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6iM9ypJN_yzcjote	user	16	3	What is brining?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6nMy00Tt9Y6sYKse	agent	119	21	Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6vSoancJRmbMelTj	user	45	7	That's very interesting, what does brining do
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM6vn7Z86UOCauNJrG	user	1	0	?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM70UTztlNItkmR49Z	agent	27	6	I'm happy to tell you this.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7585yS1_dj7s0uca	agent	215	35	As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together). As the myosin dissolves, three things take place:
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM77taUu5L6vt1DXax	agent	63	11	First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7E1ziBe_CHdaOESy	agent	248	37	Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. This is the main principle behind sausage making—dissolved proteins can bond with each other, creating a pleasantly bouncy, tender texture.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7FvTYVDZufAoNGZo	agent	233	41	Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7KBdZSPDn4HL2PZf	agent	23	3	Interesting, right? :-D
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7RU-omojD198aeRP	user	19	3	That is interesting
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7STkMNzJvm89tZ9b	user	9	2	Thank you
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM7g6jxCzFYEE9AQOv	agent	70	12	You can also spot a visual difference between unbrined and brined meat
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM87rcSmhAWC82o_l-	user	10	3	Can I see?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM8Acl0t_ZvA6AIVMj	agent	5	1	Sure!
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM8FshrXcp_-d0JtuC	user	25	3	Definitely more moisture!
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM8Iyq9xzk6TxtAT6G	agent	7	2	Oh yes!
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM8RGDpXyeJGimLcbc	agent	62	10	Also: Using buttermilk affects the outcome in a special way :)
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM9KbxYFNiGHX67D6z	user	7	2	How so?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM9WVb-tmq5Jm2rLa3	agent	406	72	If you replace water with buttermilk, not only does the chicken come out just as moist as with water brine, it is actually significantly more tender as well, due to the tenderizing effects of buttermilk on food (soaking it for more than one night led to chicken that was so tender that it bordered on mush). Finally, hitting the buttermilk with spices helps build flavor right into the surface of the bird.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBM9yFYqIqvcRtqBiwf	agent	107	19	So these are the key features you should know about brining.  Was it helpful? Do you need more information?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMA3-0QBWKqqRPdLCs	user	23	4	Very helpful thank you!
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMA7HlgU4nevUVg-EI	agent	6	1	Great!
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMAEQUDaLnjoC3s54G	agent	54	12	If you wish to go to the next step, simply say "Next".
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMAFVdjYuyx-wxPTiB	user	4	1	next
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMAM1CfhFg0qMNiM9G	agent	602	107	Step 3:  Whisk together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, 2 teaspoons salt, and the remaining spice mixture in a large bowl. Add 3 tablespoons of the marinade from the zipper-lock bag and work it into the flour with your fingertips. Remove one piece of chicken from the bag, allowing excess buttermilk to drip off, drop the chicken into the flour mixture, and toss to coat. Continue adding chicken pieces to the flour mixture one at a time until they are all in the bowl. Toss the chicken until every piece is thoroughly coated, pressing with your hands to get the flour to adhere in a thick layer.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMB4kQJhUOa3A3ua8m	agent	34	8	How can I help you with this step?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMBd8pnZL3EkIIopEn	user	20	4	Think it makes sense
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMBebuy4h2k1PCFIhk	user	33	4	any chemical processes happening?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMBkpjJC2G4KJL63wl	agent	13	2	Actually yes.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMC7IC71CIU9dDtINb	agent	120	21	The ingredients we are using for the breading here, affect the result and crispiness of the crust in an interesting way.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMC9GL0bSjA7d7S4j-	user	6	2	how so
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMCLH115AfvXdeuKoN	agent	32	5	Let's start with the cornstarch.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMCjOdb6GfW-hu3F-h	agent	330	49	Knowing that gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water—is the most likely culprit that leads to a crust with an almost rock-like density.  First and foremost: cut the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMClFqXrbV8SFFMP0F	agent	45	8	Replacing a quarter of the flour worked well.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMCt2Lzr8DXegrjDdQ	user	11	2	that's cool
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMCx39OYWlhtFo5_aV	agent	62	11	Oh it is! Also baking powder is the second influencing factor!
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMCymSIFRVIEyXzI63	user	4	1	how?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMDBYekza9tWwgxLH1	agent	230	42	Adding a couple teaspoons of baking powder to the mix helps bring a bit of air to the mix, forming a crust that is lighter and crisper, with increased surface area (and we all know that more surface area = more crispness, right?).
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMDJ5g6IUp_3nLYPCi	agent	188	33	The reason is: baking powder raises the pH of the skin, causing it to brown more efficiently and the thin film of protein-rich liquid around it to form microbubbles that can add crispness.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMDUaGrK8xwLzxsk6o	agent	44	8	So that's the magic behind baking powder :-D
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMDdLMX_YluPMYMz9o	user	9	2	very cool
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBME-GwNJS-GuJcGt2B	agent	72	14	Do you want to hear another trick about how to make an extra-caggy coat?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBME47dysG4jViqohlN	user	3	1	yes
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMEHEcc5YdHZBTlP2e	agent	330	54	Once the chicken was breaded, the later batches always come out better than the earlier ones as bits of the flour mixture clump together, making for an extra-craggy coat.  Adding a couple tablespoons of buttermilk to the breading mix and working it in with your fingertips before dredging the chicken simulates this effect nicely.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMEKuN-C86WQCb6Zxb	user	22	5	can you show me videos
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMETB2rrvI4MpFz3qk	agent	48	9	Unfortunately not, but I can show you a picture:
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMEoTYLo68Y_AUvdk2	agent	56	10	That's how you add some buttermilk to the flour mixture.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMF-3BYv92LYWGXTzN	user	19	3	what is buttermilk?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMF8vcfIrDLphxKlMD	agent	737	117	Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. However, most modern buttermilk is cultured. It is common in warm climates (including the Balkans, South Asia, the Middle East and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly. Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making Soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, which the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMFX--3N8SUNUwMdsN	agent	44	10	Was it helpful? Or do you want to hear more?
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMGMQOrrMflJFg1FA6	user	11	2	more please
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMGX5eVgptJN3zbwON	agent	733	120	Buttermilk is the byproduct of butter making.Butter is made by agitating cream resulting in clumps of fat and a milky white liquid that contains nearly no fat and some protein. If the cream was soured before (either by aging or by inoculating the cream with lactobacillae), the buttermilk will also be sour. If the butter was made from unfermented cream, the buttermilk will be mild.Uncultured buttermilk is rarely sold, even if butter is made commercially with regular cream, the resulting buttermilk is soured afterwards.As buttermilk is made from a fraction of whole milk (the cream), you could say it’s a part of soured milk. I outlined the process of butter making in this answer, that should also help understanding buttermilk.
o9UbVjHVrS	active	-NBMHAkyute0loU9x5Cy	agent	22	3	Any further questions?

rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHfpBpcCEwW3CggiT9	agent	377	61	So a soufflé is a fundamentally simple thing that leverages the power of eggs to achieve impressive results.  All classic soufflés, sweet and savory, start with a base that provides richness and structure.  In savory soufflés, like the cheese soufflé I'm demonstrating here, the base is a thick béchamel sauce, usually calling for about three tablespoons flour per cup of milk.
rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHfwN2jweVVRbbzJlT	agent	15	3	Was it helpful?

rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHh2BCc9yZYlGrpD9t	agent	137	28	To some extent yes. It helps to form a delicious crispy crust, but don't mix it into the soufflé itself. This it how it looks in the end:

rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHhlBVHSLeNtDv1yeA	agent	289	50	As specified earlier, in savory soufflés, like the cheese soufflé, the base is a thick béchamel sauce, usually calling for about three tablespoons flour per cup of milk.

rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHm-YHOjtA5CFkSWDh	user	29	7	why do we use cream of tatar?
rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHmmck1F9bCXuwjSgq	agent	388	64	Actually it's some sort of policy against over-beaten egg whites. You can either use an expensive copper egg-beating bowl, which helps form more stable beaten whites that are less prone to breaking and weeping (the copper interferes with too-strong sulfur bonds from forming). You can add a little cream of tartar to the whites, an acid that also prevents those sulfur bonds from forming.
rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHmrTWB_TSzfXyGRlA	agent	120	23	So to sum it up, if you want an insurance policy against messed-up egg whites, copper or cream of tartar are good ideas.

rEG2v4CE7m	active	-NBHpCIYITXeAHqXZ33p	agent	530	99	Kind of. That gentle folding is key, since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them. That's what causes a soufflé to rise, and really, there's no stopping it—your beaten whites will contain air bubbles and those air bubbles will expand, and when they do your soufflé will push higher and higher in its baking dish.

But the soufflé is also more likely to remain runny in the center, since it'd come close to burning on the outside if you were to leave it long enough to cook through to the center.

XYjHSL2Ky3	active	-NBWwj3B2wfvOslLL-w9	agent	707	125	By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough. Adding butter and other fats to the dough will further diminish its gluten-forming abilities. If we were to try and make gnocchi with a cold water dough, one with plenty of springy, elastic gluten, we'd have a heck of a time getting those gnocchi hot enough to expand to the point where they come out nice and airy; Instead, we'd end up with dense, chewy nubs that taste more like damp bread.
XYjHSL2Ky3	active	-NBWws_5D2opzcXUyyAk	agent	29	3	That's interesting, right? :)

XYjHSL2Ky3	active	-NBWyk0EiJU6-WCJ3m1n	agent	251	46	It's not easy to tell... So basil and dill do not taste like parsley. But you can use fresh something else in its place. Dried herbs cannot give the same vivacity. Chives for example give the right amount of freshness with a bonus light oniony flavor.

XYjHSL2Ky3	active	-NBWzn2wHtQHEWBeebQD	agent	549	96	It is a flat, rectangular metal pan used in an oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, Swiss rolls and pizzas. Typically, for rimmed trays, each rim will sacrifice 0.5–0.75 inches (1–2 cm) of baking surface along that edge. Pans of a single design from a single vendor will usually share the same rim height and rake across all tray sizes in a series, thus the sacrifice of flat baking surface is proportionally greater (relative to outer dimension) for small pans than for large pans.

8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRppxea_6OjWmVp-Fw	agent	690	115	Pine nuts, also called piñón () or pinoli (), sometimes called pignoli in the US, are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus "Pinus"). About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines, the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of notable value as a human food. Throughout Europe and Middle East the pine nuts used are traditionally from "Pinus pinea" (stone pine). They are easily distinguished from the Asian pine nuts by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian pine nuts are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations. Pine nuts contain thiamine (vitamin B) and protein.

Sesame seeds would also offer a solution to those with nut allergies that don't have pine nuts on hand.

However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the temperate zone, and others in subtropical climates. Although basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.

8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRs4llnKUT4MFMVXPy	user	33	9	how do i know how much oil to add
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsDsS5Jgg04N_MvyE	agent	52	11	For the pesto, you can add 3/4 cup (175ml) olive oil
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsIl9MOM7KEQuzXn7	agent	48	10	Don't forget to pick the right type of olive oil
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsLIOx4V5cfVTazmT	user	22	5	what type should i use
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsbTD397GbyQ3sz8Z	agent	99	18	The Ligurian oil, for instance, is buttery and rounded in flavor, and a good choice for your pesto.
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsdayJjlvrNS-mWM-	agent	210	38	But as long as you're using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good; if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsm_7g-nZ_ZwCxlWs	user	30	7	ok great ill bare that in mind
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsnzmHErLgDiqN30w	agent	6	1	Great!
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRsooUDHda15aqScfp	user	37	9	what do i do after ive made the pesto
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRt-L-mZn-VnbDzqU5	agent	129	26	At this step, also have in mind the type of cheese you choose. This also affects the flavour of your pesto in a very special way.
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRt501tDtTomZqsVs5	user	24	5	what cheese should i use
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtCBiyLFxdY_yQuwH	agent	143	19	Historically, the cheeses of true Ligurian pesto were Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Sardo (or Fiore Sardo), a Sardinian sheep's-milk cheese.
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtGhLFiOPuWr_tqQ9	user	25	7	can i get this in the ukl
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtHJxzO1uZdt_n2KZ	agent	196	34	If you can find the Fiore Sardo, it will make a marginally better pesto sauce, but Pecorino Romano makes a darned good one, too (and, frankly, Parmigiano-Reggiano alone makes a great one as well).
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtKL7EMY2wz80LHq7	agent	25	5	oh that's a good question
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtLvh4rZZwLfA4YhC	agent	13	3	Let me see...
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtTiFuVjTwTX9C3iy	agent	49	10	I'm sorry, I do not think I have this information
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtYMmo7mIlL7CmnHz	user	32	7	dont worry what should i do next
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRtdNBnB4TMFxnEjWI	user	33	7	is it best fresh or after storage
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRth3-_g8yA7lJHHAc	agent	16	4	Give me a moment
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRuOMOIDqBMk8Igprm	agent	244	40	From the moment you finished making the pesto, it may start to lose flavor. Freezing halts the deterioration of the highly volatile aromatics, particularly basil, that give pesto much of its vibrancy. Based on this, fresh pesto tastes the best.
8nJXjVjBTQ	active	-NBRuU8y97L2MdtpIwhp	user	42	10	ok great, ill cook pasta to go with it now

5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5trsBlSSG3JFTZfGQO	user	15	4	What is step 1?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ts4lH0mn38GbiG-9C	agent	30	7	I mean step 1 of the recipe :)
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tsChEGZmQfeoCcupi	user	52	12	What is the first step I should take? I don't see it
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tsRkfNBFzR7DfuSOC	agent	56	12	Oh sorry that shouldn't be like that. So this is step 1:
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tsSTjvB_z-98T7mj6	agent	279	44	For the Filling: Combine brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, ginger, nutmeg, and cloves in a gallon-sized zip-top bag (do not add tapioca at this time). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, then slice into 1/2-inch wedges; significant deviation can change the consistency of the filling.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tstWjxmQOd4FvgdW-	user	4	1	Next
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tt0qJ5tsYGYdWg4em	agent	101	20	Before we skip to the next step. Why do you think apples should be put in a gallon-sized zip-top bag?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttBYGGSdOQRblyApR	user	78	15	I think because it's an easy way to mix the ingredients without making a mess?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttVMvDeyq0Kz8Oa6X	agent	69	11	You're right! That's one important aspect. But there are also others:
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttb5GXlF051usdJPg	agent	287	48	Not only does this minimize cleanup down the road, it limits the fruit's exposure to air, meaning less oxidation, and it lets me toss everything together without making a mess. ( A five-quart-capacity bowl will do the same thing, but that will also increase the fruit's exposure to air.)
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttfPOj1jTfcZgtebx	user	6	2	I see!
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttm32j9regMeCVvPM	agent	73	15	This is how you do it. And the result of this procedure is the following:
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttnyfg9bxg0e8BD35	agent	140	25	The liquid you see after macerating the apples is a syrup composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttsZ1mZ1OCCNZYh9t	agent	41	9	However, let's go on to the next step now
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ttwbbgeGYxrNghA_m	agent	342	61	This is step 2:  Measure 50 ounces sliced apples (11 rounded cups; 1.45kg) into the bag, seal tightly, and tumble until roughly coated. Macerate at room temperature, flipping the bag occasionally to distribute the syrup, until the apples have lost a third of their volume, at least 3 hours. The apples can be held up to 8 hours in the fridge.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tuRQXdyPqKninxMEJ	user	24	4	What does macerate mean?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tuktiSR2kSVton3xA	agent	459	76	Great question! So maceration is the "magic" (really science) of applied osmotic pressure. The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher. If water is needed, it would be added after maceration, in those recipes.)
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tutRUv_7Md1cjyTHJ	agent	116	22	So as you can read from that definition, it is essentially the step we performed when putting the apples in the bag!
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tuvXA3j-hSHs5icQW	user	7	1	Thanks!
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tv-16onM-S9mvmIPe	user	4	1	Next
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tv9mgGFYRtbawQGQA	agent	80	16	So speaking of apples. Which kind of apple do you pick when baking an apple pie?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tvMkP3_Hmmc1F53-n	user	36	6	I have golden delicious apples today
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tvUAIXejEm6tl2ACZ	agent	69	12	Oh that's actually a great choice! Why did you pick Golden Delicious?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tv_AWsHfdJrheLuTF	user	56	9	They were recommended in the recipe directions, and they
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tvakbVb7EerO0FG3F	user	30	6	*they're just ones that I like
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tvmNIj7XU2Qg86L4L	agent	286	50	Alright, I see. They are, indeed, very delicious. Another reason is that they're high in pectin and hold their shape nicely in the oven, which keeps the filling thick, and they're tart enough to offset the sweetness of embellishments, like a scoop of ice cream or a dollop of chantilly.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tvrl_aFxRI5NGydh3	agent	65	12	So you could also pick Braeburn or Granny Smith for this purpose.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5twHxhPHOfNraghQrP	agent	639	114	Alright let's go on with step 3:   Add tapioca starch to the apples, reseal, and toss to combine. Pour apple filling into the prepared pie shell, nestling the slices into a flattish mound. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck the dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design). Refrigerate the pie until cold and firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5twVN9EgbzDHvqGl4l	user	42	8	What is the purpose of the tapioca starch?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5twzZd1FGssW9Iialr	agent	833	148	Good question:  The liquid you see after macerating the apples is a syrup composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. ( The mixture weighs little more than the brown sugar added in step one.) This is more or less the same thing that happens with my fresh lemon syrup, in which dry lemon rinds are tossed with seven ounces of sugar to yield a scant eight ounces of syrup after a few hours. That lack of moisture means there's no need to spend time and energy cooking the liquid down to concentrate the "juices," as the liquid is already quite concentrated in terms of both flavor and water content. Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose, while the overall water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5txIbcIqZp6vSAx7R0	agent	112	18	It's also important to note that waiting to add the tapioca starch prevents it from interfering with maceration.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5txQRNx-sHS7ww72nT	agent	24	5	It looks like this then:
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5txdjrKBr1yjCK-4KO	user	4	1	Next
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5txoajPQtvjM3WLZfW	agent	103	21	Before we go next, I want to highlight the selection of the pie shell. Which kind of shell do you pick?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5ty0m9S909eDCSf2bO	user	45	8	What different kinds of pie shells are there?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tyFKa67-NpgAKthZC	agent	102	18	So you could pick, for instance, a ceramic plate, aluminium and glass. These are the most common ones.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tyJnLjAy4lwwi9pNW	agent	46	10	Which one do you think is best for apple pies?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tyM5TlqArgMy5IZxs	agent	8	2	And why?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tyhmtcUrqdSHTWiH6	user	129	27	If I had to guess, I would say aluminium? I may be wrong, but the answer probably has something to do with how well it holds heat
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tyuP3Xs20PcPaI3s8	agent	617	109	So your guess regarding the heat is correct! That's the important thing. In our case, glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie. Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tzFYoEup2PmSNc6FZ	user	12	1	Interesting!
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tzKSVrPWr4kI8V_no	agent	54	10	Any further questions? Otherwise we can jump to Step 4
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tzQR5gKT8DrytFAer	user	20	3	No further questions
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tzRYvaeC9oPeAfauL	agent	251	50	So this is step 4:  For the Egg Wash: Whisk egg, yolk, cream, and salt together in a small bowl, then brush over the chilled pie. With a sharp knife, cut six 3-inch vents around the top, wiggling the blade left and right to open each into a wide vent.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tzizs3Xt0W1pzo3vN	user	4	1	Next
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5tzvwU9VPAmRacq1ME	agent	80	18	In this step, it is important to cut vents in the pie. Why is that do you think?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u-EMJ7A4lesYVlxqs	user	63	12	It lets the steam and heat escape so the filling cooks properly
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u-ONC6wv4A-TT91nH	agent	127	24	You're right! It does also affect the crust: when vents are cut too narrow, entrapped steam can make the top crust a bit mushy.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u-RdjG5w-jlynk-dY	agent	32	7	This is how it should look like:
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u-VzP5OpKdAzk3Dia	agent	278	48	No for Step 5:  To Bake: Place pie on a parchment-lined aluminum half sheet pan and bake until 195°F (91°C) in the very center, about 75 minutes. This is easiest to monitor with an in-oven digital thermometer, which can be programmed to chime on reaching the target temperature.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u05WVY8hqfKJfY4KW	user	4	1	Next
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u0L_WrYqeV4svimVf	agent	158	32	Before we reach the final step: Did you notice that we should bake the pie at only 195°F (91°C)? However, a few steps before we had to heat the oven to 400°F.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u0R7GgB2iCJjTYQov	agent	71	14	Can you think of an advantage to cooling it down whilst baking the pie?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u0W3-_ywQCfanK3xD	user	22	4	What is the advantage?
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u0bkEUZVrm_yAVJJS	agent	493	81	It is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u0tG3RUc0YhENsZRY	user	5	1	Cool!
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u0xeD_Ibdk0vbUe4M	agent	223	40	The last step:  To Serve: Cool at least 1 hour at room temperature before serving. Wrapped in foil, leftovers will keep 3 days at room temperature. Warm in a 350°F (180°C) oven to restore the crispy crust and saucy filling.
5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	active	-N5u1an2xgx58Cp7UdI1	user	10	2	Thank you!

612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	active	-N5juquXRZKgmHO5Ki3n	agent	344	67	That's a great question!  Beef or veal stock is ideal, since those bones give up enough gelatin to make a truly spectacular sauce. If you don't want to do that, a brown chicken stock is your next best choice; it won't have quite as much gelatin as a good beef or veal stock, so the sauce won't get quite the same body, but it'll still be great.

612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	active	-N5jwmCSBLoj4e3Gguj_	agent	419	72	Yes exactly! Its origin is actually quite interesting.  The beginning beginning takes us out of France and south to Italy. Or, at least, that's one version of the story of the origins of this dish—one that Italians are certainly fond of. According to that history, Catherine de' Medici introduced some proto-duck à l'orange to France in 1533, when she moved there with her retinue of cooks to marry the Duke of Orléans.

612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	active	-N5k-JRocdsyPCefknx8	agent	443	80	Yes that's correct! First, the meat all over is on the darker side, giving it a richer, oilier texture that can better withstand the drying effects of high temperatures. Second, and even more important, is the duck's luxuriously fatty skin, which insulates the meat and bathes it in mouth-coating rendered fat, ensuring each bite is unctuous. You can cook the crap out of a duck and as long as you eat it with the skin, it will never seem dry.

612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	active	-N5k0CqatpIoyzvGk3N2	agent	263	46	So   the sweetness in sauce bigarade isn't meant to come from the orange component.  It comes from the gastrique, which is essential to sauce bigarade.  A gastrique is a sweet-sour mixture of caramel and wine vinegar, added in small doses to a sauce to flavor it.

612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	active	-N5k0q8LrHdd2k1NwoMO	agent	684	122	Yes precisely!  To do it, you add water to the sugar first, which wets and dissolves it, speeding up the caramelization process while helping to prevent scorching. The water cooks off as the mixture boils (which, incidentally, you can swirl and stir and otherwise monkey with to ensure even browning, no wet pastry brush needed), and it's clear to the eye when the caramel reaches a nice deep amber color. At this point, you can add the vinegar in very small additions, gently swirling as you do; it will boil and bubble violently, so take your time to avoid a boil-over. Some of the sugar might seize up a bit, but if you keep swirling, it'll dissolve back into the solution quickly.

612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	active	-N5k3j_gNKx8KLpwQPou	agent	2035	369	If you've ever carved a roast chicken or turkey before, then you've got nothing to worry about, because cutting the meat off a duck crown is the same as carving the breasts of any roast bird. And even if you haven't done much carving in your life, don't sweat it; it's easy. The most important thing you need to do in terms of carving happens before the duck even goes in the oven—removing the wishbone. As I mentioned in the primer for dry-aging ducks, I like to remove the wishbone after the birds have finished aging in the fridge. The skin and flesh around the neck cavity dry out during the aging process, making it easier to locate and cut out the wishbone cleanly, without taking a chunk of breast meat with it. Once the crown is roasted and rested, carving the breasts off the cage is pretty simple. Use a sharp knife, preferably a slicer with a long thin blade that allows you to cut with smooth even strokes. Slice into the breast on one side of the breastbone and use steady, smooth knife strokes, riding the contour of the breastbone with the blade and gently pulling the breast back with your off-hand as you cut. The breast will gradually pull away from the cage, and you can cut it away completely at the point where it connects with the shoulder joint. Remove the second breast and then set aside the crown carcass for making another batch of duck stock. Take a second to trim up the breasts before slicing and serving. The bottom edge of the breast where it protruded from the crown has very little meat along with some tough cartilage and skin. Place the breasts skin-side-down on your board, trim off those pieces, and discard them. On the upper edge of the breast, you will find a large pocket of fat between the meat and skin. I like to trim that away as well. Now you get to pick your preferred slicing presentation for serving. You can slice the breasts crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces that are ideal for a family-style meal or in half, lengthwise, if you're going for more of a minimalist fine-dining vibe.

57272517e386b9000e3e2b72	active	-N4Mr7l1C7sZUBvsitva	agent	303	50	Yes, precisely!  Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution.  As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together).
57272517e386b9000e3e2b72	active	-N4MrBrGA-gRgjD3jEx-	agent	322	55	As the myosin dissolves, three things take place: First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases. Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface.

57272517e386b9000e3e2b72	active	-N4Mta3KZ6nyw6ql6pLn	agent	387	66	Yes precisely. The coating overcooks long before the chicken is cooked through to the center. Hence, just fry the chicken until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace. The result is chicken with a deep brown, craggy crust that's shatteringly crisp but not tough and that breaks away to meat that bursts with intensely seasoned juices underneath.

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5elyiABUvM_1uWjlx-	user	32	7	Why is the cooking time so long?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5emJW9D1zqn8z45moC	agent	128	24	It takes  345 minutes to fully prepare the fried chicken. This is because you need to first prepare the mixture and then fry it.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5emSiEY6MEVAQz4Upk	user	66	14	and if i don't have shortening or peanut oil can i use canola oil?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5emngIMCxfuAzB5rTE	agent	397	62	Peanut and canola are vegetable oils. Oils labelled vegetable oil are blends and can be any proportion of things like canola (rapeseed), peanut, corn, sunflower, etc. Different vegetable oils will give different properties although most will give you about the same result. Canola is flavorless and relatively light while peanut is a bit richer and, well, peanut-y. The differences will be subtle.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5emwjqlLc0r3Qky6Bm	user	39	7	oh okay. thank you for that information

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5en54LFbEtg5KPOt8M	user	89	16	I have all the ingredients now, can you help me start with cutting the chicken correctly?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5enEEupG5yfV-EtxZx	agent	37	9	Yes sure, let me see what I can find!
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5enfyfeuG5CCRQl-EQ	agent	1680	309	This might help you! Remove the wings. Stand the chicken on its neck, legs point to the ceiling and breasts pointing away from you. slide the cleaver between the body and wing, cutting through the joint close to the body.  You should slide the knife between the joint cutting only the tendons, not the bone.Remove the legs.  lie the chicken on its back one leg near you, one leg away from you.  slide the knife between the joint near the body, again cutting only tendon not bone and remove the leg.Separate the thigh from the drumstick, again go for the joint.  If you want the legs to be in smaller pieces then you can cut each thigh and drumstick in two with a firm action.  You have 2 choices for techniqueStart with the cleaver tip furthest from you on the board, place the thigh under the blade and push down firmly and quickly.  you should cut through the bone.Chop through the bone by lifting the cleaver in the air and bringing down hard and fast.  This has better chance of a cleaner cut through the bone, but you need to be a better aim. Split the carcass in half.  Stand in the same position as 1. and with the blade parallel to to your body cut down through the carcass so you have the back and the breast in separate piecesRemove the breast from the bone by sliding the knife (might want to use a smaller knife here) between the meat and the bone.  Remove the backbone out of the back, kitchen scissors are easiest.  you can skip this if the back doesn't have much meat.Cut the back pieces into nice size pieces across the length.Slice the breast pieces crosswise into nice size piecesReassemble the chicken on the plate with the breast meat on top of the back pieces
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eny92Rhe-YmZ8jLOo	agent	136	22	I apologize for the long response, but after learning that you'll definitely be a chicken expert. However, be careful when using knives!

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eq0jRxRGaX5WQaK_b	agent	66	13	Quiz time :)! Can I ask you why brining is important in this step?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eq9n_pc2ASS2WeXXB	user	82	15	So that the flavor really gets settled inside the chicken well and makes it moist?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqR_kc7QFdLzkXy-5	agent	335	56	oh wow, that's correct!! You really are an expert!Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution. As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together).
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqUbdEAshkLWNcpOn	agent	49	8	As the myosin dissolves, three things take place:
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqW9_2kvgXAfxT2JR	agent	63	11	First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eq_G9oU0tdXm-vCCH	agent	248	37	Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. This is the main principle behind sausage making—dissolved proteins can bond with each other, creating a pleasantly bouncy, tender texture.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqa-bIb_61mZBrSO2	agent	99	19	Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqonelHH_ljLkNnA6	agent	60	10	However, in this case, you can replace water with buttermilk
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqsj7Kjx8XDtZs-Kz	user	69	13	i did not know all the science behind it! Great information to learn.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5eqxUq3aHQHRHJU8Ph	user	73	11	Wouldn't replacing buttermilk with water affect the taste of the chicken?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5erFN3zk351uPzGO2i	agent	218	38	Not it won't! Replace water with buttermilk not only makes the chicken come out just as moist as with water brine, but it actually makes it significantly more tender due to the tenderizing effects of buttermilk on food
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5erNTuXN85IUOZCaT2	agent	58	9	Look at the difference between brined and unbrined chicken
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5erU71EPyIq6-jYOD7	user	37	6	unbrined chicken does not look pretty
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5erZnwdMmm3QbEjB8Z	agent	27	5	i totally agree with you :)

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5es76pEAqgEvprXI6B	agent	28	6	1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5es8o7Lcmg9tRHnwUS	agent	18	3	1/2 cup cornstarch

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5esK-WqoiD7McSODTU	user	14	3	got it. thnaks
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5esRwSLw6cVuoiX5BN	agent	159	30	In this step cornstarch and baking powder play a crucial role if you want to make a light and crisp crust. Unless you'd like to make a rock-like density one...
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5esaRfTz7aO_irTG8u	user	95	18	if we don't add the cornstarch and baking powder does it make the chicken soggy or really hard?
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5esyfU7DDtxRyqSlgC	agent	362	55	Yes precisely!  The problem here is gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water which could cause the crust to become really hard and with rock-like density.  By cutting the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein you would solve this issue.
5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5et4WRI7KqIhZM0FvF	agent	152	30	Moreover,  adding a couple of teaspoons of baking powder to the mix helps to bring a bit of air to the mix, forming a crust that is lighter and crisper,

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5ewRLnWMgfbrdaRKjg	agent	100	23	I would say it depends on how you cut it. But for this step, try to place skin side down in the pan.

5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	active	-N5exPdeRBF_bKZ6-qXn	agent	282	44	The temperature difference has to do with the thickness of the different chicken pieces. For this reason you need to bake until thickest part of breast pieces registers 150°F (65.5°C) on an instant-read thermometer, and thigh/drumstick pieces register 165°F (74°C), 5 to 10 minutes;

j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNFoMEjAR4VxBmjOUn	agent	225	39	The cayenne pepper is a type of "Capsicum annuum". It is usually a moderately hot chili pepper used to flavor dishes. Cayenne peppers are probably named after the place Cayenne in French Guiana ad that's where they come from.

j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNIDan_d_I9pdryORV	user	68	12	Sweet souffles are sweet and made with sugar and savoury ones aren't
j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNIFZbN4tMM7GscFxa	user	17	3	*sour ones aren't
j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNIS0KP_7FFAPszlrA	agent	289	49	All classic soufflés, sweet and savory, start with a base that provides richness and structure. In savory soufflés the base is a thick béchamel sauce.  In sweet soufflés, the base is often pastry cream. However, you can just as easily sweeten béchamel and make a dessert soufflé from that.
j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNIjm6Gy0GavRpHneQ	user	31	6	What's the origin of a souffle?
j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNIyFuYRUm9e5it85Q	agent	288	44	That's a great question! The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century.

j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNKw3AFn-c0rg4MRRq	agent	178	32	You should preheat oven to 400°F (200°C) for a more browned soufflé with a slightly looser center or 375°F (190°C) for a more gently cooked soufflé that sets all the way through.
j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNKyIrEynts5s6SfsE	agent	358	62	The oven temperature has a couple important effects on a soufflé. First, the heat of the oven is a critical "ingredient" for getting a soufflé to rise; it's what causes gases to expand inside all those trapped air bubbles and what converts moisture in the soufflé batter to steam. Together, those forces expand the air bubbles and cause the soufflé to swell.
j6iz4akqr2	active	-NBNL09iOhfIsCMBKIEH	agent	123	24	The hotter the oven, the more quickly and fully the soufflé will rise, and the faster it will brown and set on the outside.

ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMQVn826T19aLA6hwW	agent	201	34	Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine. Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents.

ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMRf1h7OkpN6z3TNaK	agent	103	19	Before going to the next step, I want to highlight that this first step is crucial when making gnocchi.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMRlGBxkX9-F5226Hm	user	18	4	why is it crucial?
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSFbczk6JzL-iBRvI	agent	175	28	S parisian gnocchi are somewhat of an oddity in the Western repertoire, in that they're made with a hot water dough—much like Chinese-style dumpling or stretched noodle dough.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSM15NkfJq4B5frgw	agent	157	27	With a hot water dough, By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMST43ah1jupBOui1P	agent	180	31	Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSUQDaszfJG6Airyi	agent	93	14	Adding butter and other fats to the dough will further diminish its gluten-forming abilities.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSXNm9ej6NQdq8f2g	agent	90	17	As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSiirauFC_yQlKBhM	agent	102	18	This fact that a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy is essential when making Parisian Gnocchi
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSsgj6w3YXAElYqOB	user	24	5	where do they come from?
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMSyCPwPUuqg8D1OOC	agent	53	11	Would you like to know about the origin of this dish?
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMT1aULnusB3I39V8g	user	6	1	please
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMTjrOtwjctXxOknJ7	agent	498	81	So the word "gnocchi" may be derived from the Italian word "nocchio", meaning a knot in wood, or from "nocca" (meaning knuckle). It has been a traditional type of Italian pasta of (probable) Middle Eastern origin since Roman times. It was introduced by the Roman legions during the expansion of the empire into the countries of the European continent. Parisian Gnocchi or "gnocchis à la parisienne", is a regional French variety comprising gnocchi formed of choux pastry served with Béchamel sauce.

ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMU2VZ264TS3iqXkzw	agent	124	22	Can you tell me what's the difference between cold water dough and hot water dough and why that's important in this context?
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMUsJ2m83s2I9P3NLf	user	163	29	hot water not only denatures the proteins it also smashes them into small pieces which cold water doesn't and we need that to happen to get the elasticity required
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMV2PFE_zSoK4M7dVi	agent	335	59	That's correct! And that's really important in this context.  The beauty of a hot water dough is that, as you can see, it doesn't bounce back as much as a cold water dough does. As the gnocchi go through their primary poaching step in simmering water, water vapor and trapped gases will expand, causing the gnocchi to inflate slightly.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMV3jA9LwMtP90wzM4	agent	125	24	This change in density caused by expanding gases is what causes them to gently float to the surface of the pot as they poach.
ozf8rdojjw	active	-NBMV7JBSPwhbaGZ6zzc	agent	126	26	If we were to try and make gnocchi with a cold water dough we'd end up with dense, chewy nubs that taste more like damp bread.

The "mortar"  is a bowl, typically made of hard wood, metal, ceramic, or hard stone, such as granite. The "pestle"  is a heavy and blunt club-shaped object.

5ea196f089935b04d2ee69d9	active	-N6JmOD2dXHL6jOoyvgu	agent	485	88	You need basil. Unless you're from Liguria itself, you probably don't have access to the prized basil of that region. If you happen to grow your own, lucky you. If you have access to a good farmers market that carries beautiful tufts of fragrant basil at the height of summer, definitely go for it. If you have to settle for supermarket clamshells of hydroponic herb, well, then, that's what it's going to be. Basically, get the best fresh basil you can, and that's all there is to it.

5ea196f089935b04d2ee69d9	active	-N6JnbDmkrR-ioRRawLi	agent	196	34	Yes you can. But I'd highly recommend you use a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.

Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together. The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the "Appendix Vergiliana", an ancient collection of poems where the author dwells on the details about the preparation of "moretum". During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was "agliata", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book "La Cuciniera Genovese" in 1863:

5ea196f089935b04d2ee69d9	active	-N6JoYzO8F7LDy7Z8aTF	agent	562	84	An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids. Although the terms "colloid" and "emulsion" are sometimes used interchangeably, "emulsion" should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, and some cutting fluids for metal working.

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBMxji9WuXbMTbsqZ94	agent	259	44	While it's often said that when making apple pie, using a variety of apples can create depth of flavor. However, this can also introduce unnecessary variables into the equation, with some types of apples breaking down more quickly to flood the pie with juice.
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBMxome7KQSY-0wWKlG	user	49	12	Can you show me a video of how to cut the apples?

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBMywNxa4sO8RRBVEOC	agent	224	39	In food preparation, maceration is softening or breaking into pieces using a liquid. Raw, dried or preserved fruit or vegetables are soaked in a liquid to soften the food and/or absorb the flavor of the liquid into the food.
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBMz19j_4qNc4kh6Ka8	agent	130	20	In this context,  macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking.

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBMzIIvmCylNFQhGKLy	user	31	6	Why did you add tapioca starch?
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBMzvzqhPcEV7DZyz8-	agent	406	69	The liquid you see after macerating the apples is a syrup composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. That lack of moisture means there's no need to spend time and energy cooking the liquid down to concentrate the "juices," as the liquid is already quite concentrated. Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose.
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN-0Kd3sL2EiYQzatT	agent	96	17	In this context, water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch.
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN-GZjQLlLiFG4lpLL	user	39	9	Can you show me how to pinch the crust?

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN-hwjlx41lFgSb1d0	user	38	6	Why do you refrigerate before cooking?
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN1ZV6Ntx2Y_sTahOY	agent	83	15	Chilling ensures the dough is cold to start, which keeps the crust flaky and light.

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN2EjKTSGk7KzSDOQn	agent	197	39	An egg wash is often used to make pastries shiny and golden or brown in color, and it also is used to help toppings or coatings stick to the surface of the pastry, or to bind pastry parts together.
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN2Lm6oZDeN8MoGpKa	user	50	12	can you show me a video of how to place the vents?

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN2wVvqw8RCX-kW3_m	agent	56	11	In this step, I would recommend using a glass pie plate.
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN3-KxjTHACqMlXYgc	user	28	6	Why is a glass plate better?
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN37MPWfXVMhbdmOKQ	agent	544	97	A glass pie plate is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN4BiyPkijd3HWKuTn	agent	116	22	You should bake the pie bake until it reaches 195°F (91°C) in the very center. In other words, for about 75 minutes.

v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN4S9NsGoLkBrw62tz	agent	183	34	before going to the next step, can I ask you why you think we should bake our cake at a temperature that is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings?
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN4aCRulQ6iCLlrV8K	user	45	8	Because you are cooking it for longer instead
v684ge8cmo	active	-NBN4lM6vOvo6__zIxpx	agent	278	43	When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.

eiRY3df7Aq	active	-NBXYS2cErFO4V1biQlE	user	195	36	Yes, is there a specific reason for it being Kosher Salt? And could I substitute another salt if we're having trouble finding this? If so, would it impact any of the other ingredients in any way?
eiRY3df7Aq	active	-NBXYfffbSt8FPC_YtJ1	agent	524	90	That's a great question! And yes there is a reason for using it! Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine. Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents. Because the salt has a purer flavor due to the lack of metallic or bitter-tasting additives such as iodine, fluoride or dextrose, it is often used in the kitchen instead of additive-containing table salt, so such flavors are not introduced to prepared food.
eiRY3df7Aq	active	-NBXYtAn1jvx9VuNmRdL	agent	57	12	But if you don't have it you can probably use table salt.
eiRY3df7Aq	active	-NBXZ2gc2tEBAHKJJfne	user	104	21	And there'd be no change to any of the other ingredients to compensate if I did end up using table salt?

eiRY3df7Aq	active	-NBXbWpWqE1JVFAeO47h	agent	88	15	Blanching is heating the meat (by boiling or steaming) for a specific number of minutes.
eiRY3df7Aq	active	-NBXbbT3GXscSt67UY_P	agent	185	29	Blanching helps set the bird into picture-perfect form; the skin tightens in the hot water, and because the duck is buoyant, any potentially asymmetrical effects of gravity are negated.

ABFwuoU	active	-NH9uaIAjHUEgmlhHiiV	user	49	10	why do we use garlic powder and not fresh garlic?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9un5Ul8-tWeF-qJy2	agent	13	3	Let me see...
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9v7lS7YIIpdjZSfZY	agent	338	55	Some folks shun garlic powder, saying that it's nothing like real garlic. That's true to some extent, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its culinary uses. It's particularly effective in spice rubs and breadings, where fresh garlic would be difficult to incorporate, due to its texture. Therefore, we need garlic powder in this recipe.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9vO-KeG4m2SQd3-uk	agent	31	5	Does this answer your question?

ABFwuoU	active	-NH9woEBznrGIaILWFSo	user	29	6	what is the next step please?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9wvTxPtY6QQ22O849	agent	50	9	Before moving on - have you ever heard of brining?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9x-rbriJtVmBRotH_	agent	29	6	This is important to do here.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9x1XIqYJXMx4Yx8ad	user	32	6	No, is it similar to marinating?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9x94SmFIU79YT93qU	agent	301	51	Indeed, it is!  Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution. As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together).
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9xEFEmxRzQP-Y7siN	agent	90	18	If you are familiar with marinating, what do you think are the effects it has on the meat?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9xSQL7h8ZJ5Zb1VOg	user	82	13	It adds extra moisture,flavour and helps in keeping the meat tender while cooking.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9xlGpmsRScWAiE9Dt	agent	485	84	Wow, seems that you're already an expert :-) You're right:  First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases.  Breading will help mitigate this effect to a degree by slowing down the transfer of energy to the meat, but a significant amount of squeezing is still going to occur regardless of how well breaded the chicken is. Myosin is one of the key proteins responsible for this squeezing action, so by dissolving it, you prevent a lot of moisture loss from taking place.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9xnQGvYLqleE9K8Nv	agent	482	78	Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. This is the main principle behind sausage making—dissolved proteins can bond with each other, creating a pleasantly bouncy, tender texture. Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9yCZevuS2Oww8c-L1	user	76	15	That is far more in depth of what I thought. Very interesting to learn that!
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9yIAmcEZjUsUQn6_-	agent	23	4	Happy to hear that! :-)
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9yKYDoPe_J3E08gGz	agent	33	7	Do you want to hear more details?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9yOa9o9iYSK7_j5hC	user	11	2	yes please.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9ymMMDSwdhaNpuwIN	agent	437	77	What is also really helpful is substituting the water with buttermilk. By doing this, the chicken comes out just as moist as with water brine, and it is significantly more tender as well, due to the tenderizing effects of buttermilk on food (soaking it for more than one night led to chicken that was so tender that it bordered on mush).  Finally, hitting the buttermilk with spices helps build flavor right into the surface of the bird.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9ytjn77Hbbv_cvuER	agent	84	12	Brines also improve juiciness by increasing the muscles' ability to retain moisture.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9z4qWziRegUISihhk	agent	68	11	When looking at this image you see the differences described before:
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9zN12vBGnFQ_naSg2	user	39	8	That seems to be a very big difference!
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9zTkmjIzibfDdq6vk	agent	17	4	Yes it is, right?
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9zgEeAEXle191Y2bd	user	51	10	The time taken to brine seems like time well spent.
ABFwuoU	active	-NH9zrtP_IN7GZ11zFSg	agent	239	36	Yes. The picture is the result of six hours submerged in salt/sugar water.  Weighing the meat confirms that an overnight-brined-then-fried bird loses about nine percent less moisture than an unbrined bird does and is significantly tastier.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA-Bw8xjPi3-_Qbb5I	agent	45	8	Do you have any more questions about brining?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA-QjU5hAhvFZdeJFd	user	80	16	So brining in a recipe is one of the most important steps in cooking the recipe?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA-jPUpjotJSmJTv41	agent	133	25	It surely is at it affects both the flavor and the crust. But there are also other techniques that help to make the crust crispier...
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA-vDDhUHI6RT6KF_6	user	40	6	what techniques make the crust crispier?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA00ZiuEEiBmKmNF7h	agent	39	10	Let me tell you. This is part of Step 3
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA08Ffuw2w1CeI6VkA	user	21	4	Okay, please tell me.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA0FA0WV0pERt7gRKv	agent	219	40	In this step, salt acts as a brine, while the baking powder raises the pH of the skin, causing it to brown more efficiently and the thin film of protein-rich liquid around it to form microbubbles that can add crispness.

ABFwuoU	active	-NHA0_1VKgJUSCTMlUiu	user	42	9	That looks so good it is making me hungry!
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA0oECLVVnDSZc0R42	agent	64	11	But there are also other techniques to make it even crispier :-)
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA0sNnRxlBysIKd-WO	user	94	18	What is I have difficulty in getting a thick layer of the flour mixture on the chicken pieces?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA17UJ3BRz_s1mBaXq	agent	127	24	Great question!  You could simply add a bit of extra structure to the breading in the form of an egg mixed into the buttermilk.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA1J09sinlUvZU-Jeq	agent	126	24	But notice when dipping it multiple times into the breading that it has a tendency to fall off the breast because of its heft.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA1YbL-X8r-j9Ihfr1	user	44	7	What other techniques make it even crispier?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA1pHXndvnMrVoxAxL	agent	673	109	What happens quite often here is that your crust is almost rock-like in its density.  Knowing that gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water—is the most likely culprit, you can minimize its formation.  First and foremost: cut the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein.  Replacing a quarter of the flour worked well. Adding a couple teaspoons of baking powder to the mix helped bring a bit of air to the mix, forming a crust that was lighter and crisper, with increased surface area (and we all know that more surface area = more crispness, right?).
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA2FRrR_v55wAWKkCe	agent	15	3	Was it helpful?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA2HGpEcZIMmQuzop_	user	48	9	I did not know that! Some more useful knowledge.

ABFwuoU	active	-NHA2XTapCBZRidCGDrv	agent	15	4	This is Step 4.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA2iovcATFqOR0icMR	user	50	11	Why do we need to heat the oven for fried chicken?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA2pgfl6YMx7q0tCAj	agent	38	6	Interesting question.  Let me tell you
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA3AIuOIJUaDemdQ1u	agent	441	77	One last problem you often run into is the coating overcooking long before the chicken is cooked through to the center. This can be solved quite easily:  Just fry the chicken until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace.  The result is chicken with a deep brown, craggy crust that's shatteringly crisp but not tough and that breaks away to meat that bursts with intensely seasoned juices underneath.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA3IhjjQioU3ywIpZJ	agent	86	17	So you need to preheat the oven now already to transfer the chicken to the oven later.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA3dgPrOkiCKyC-o0H	user	72	15	Okay, how long do I need to let the oven heat before frying the chicken?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA3t7BIeIetTq-jugM	agent	129	24	I'm sorry I do not have answer for this question. But it should have reached the temperature by the time you're done with frying.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA4-tF2arLvjnFVpT0	user	65	14	Do I fry all the pieces of chicken before putting it in the oven?

ABFwuoU	active	-NHA4DoaKPtJbRg7ScIa	user	39	8	Okay, let's go to the next step please.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA4M8IB4icz5Zpuign	agent	38	8	Alright, here we are at step 6 now :-)

ABFwuoU	active	-NHA4kTcFn0e6ky0wC8a	agent	4	1	sure
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA5BOE4GTZl6HRSbJ5	user	93	17	Why do the drumsticks need to be cooked until 165 degrees, 15 degrees higher than the breast?
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA5Jm1jpIof14r3b3f	agent	13	3	Let me see...
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA5vKchainYWoMJhym	agent	814	142	Ok. So breast meat is composed mainly of what are known as fast-twitch muscles—muscles that are rarely used on a day-to-day basis, but are great for quick, powerful bursts of action. Fast-twitch muscle tends to be relatively light in color and low in connective tissue and fat. Leg meat, on the other hand, is mainly slow-twitch muscle. It's used day in and day out as the turkey walks around scratching for food. As a result, it's darker and packed with tough connective tissue. Because the two muscle structures are so massively different, they must be cooked differently to achieve ideal results. Breast meat is best when cooked to no higher than about 150°F-any higher and it dries out. On the other hand, the tough connective tissue in leg meat doesn't get tender until it gets to at least 165°F (74°C) or so.
ABFwuoU	active	-NHA6EMCEO2YCd6mtygW	user	70	14	That makes a lot of sense and was very interesting to know. Thank you.

ABFwuoU	active	-NHA7GKHqpFNYSACT5xr	agent	240	44	You can refrigerate the chicken overnight and fry it a second time just before eating it. This is a wonderful way to rejuvenate fried chicken leftovers (as if such a thing exists), and your chicken will end up even better on the second day.

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWVZWVunRMXX4Nmm9S	agent	250	46	Alright. So if you're awesome with a paring knife, you can use the Jacques Pepin technique: twirl the knife around the top then the bottom, split it in half, cut out the seeds, and slice the wedges, all without ever letting the apple leave your hand.

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWWvqJ-YoesPqDseLT	agent	57	10	Yes, kind of, but there are other processes taking place:
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWX03qpz35i8VgEp_I	user	7	1	explain
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWX4tCssfc7i6fY-DR	agent	406	67	This is called maceration. You macerate the sliced apples with brown sugar and spices in a gallon-sized zip-top bag.  Not only does this minimize cleanup down the road, it limits the fruit's exposure to air, meaning less oxidation, and it lets you toss everything together without making a mess. ( A five-quart-capacity bowl will do the same thing, but that will also increase the fruit's exposure to air.)
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWXBk58YRvuC2Hz8VP	agent	20	5	You need to do this:
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWXN2FAxvKs_sg7Adz	user	22	2	that's straightforward
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWXOs9CNF2MliTzfso	agent	112	17	Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWX_SLzm5OD5K5BkOh	user	14	2	ok, understood

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWYHPSnlyk2sDhphf6	agent	13	3	Let me see...
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWYYwK2anXzC3xSkau	agent	281	53	The London pound is that of the Hansa, as used in their various trading places. The London pound is based on 16 ounces, each ounce divided as the tower ounce. It never became a legal standard in England; the use of this pound waxed and waned with the influence of the Hansa itself.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWYivjFdmn8Vjig6Ys	agent	30	6	Should be around 3 pounds then
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWYsU4yqhhLcSeMpUC	user	67	14	not sure what you are talking about but I reckon just over 3 pounds
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWYubse--GHV4gKitC	agent	7	1	Perfect
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWZ0U3LH8RZgsSMmaf	user	32	6	why is one-third of volume lost?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWZ3jMQtz1s2JAfT7K	agent	32	6	Great question!  Let me tell you
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWZQuXZ169LLcuMXrt	agent	358	65	So this is the process of maceration I told you about before. As I said, macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking. The fruit will be ready when it's lost about a third of its original volume, and about a cup of "juice" has pooled up in the bag—scare quotes because it's not really juice.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWZSjMerHdr1KBTjNE	agent	28	6	It will look like this then:
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWZdy7l_EF76N4ekuO	user	19	4	ok, that seems easy
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWZdyWXIG51WfjB1gw	agent	494	83	But to tell you more about the process of maceration. Maceration is the "magic" (really science) of applied osmotic pressure. The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher. If water is needed, it would be added after maceration, in those recipes.)

rfAHhxd	active	-NGW_aL1duOAn2iOVkd8	agent	29	5	You should proceed like this:
rfAHhxd	active	-NGW_fVHq_V_XDqD3o8B	agent	170	34	The easiest option for the border is to tuck this excess dough up under the pie and be done with it, but if the dough is properly trimmed, you can do an old-school crimp.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGW_ineDLOmgScOLTcE	user	16	3	ok, i understand
rfAHhxd	active	-NGW_oglVqzp-vhVfwNt	user	55	10	what is the temperature needed for a fan assisted oven?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGW_rJILvtxp8Zw2cqm	agent	13	3	Let me see...
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWaUAemB-kfaL_nEGp	agent	148	23	So using the convection mechanism (=fan-assisted) food is cooked faster than a conventional oven. But I cannot provide you with an exact temperature
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWaXh8twwX7g0ndqpE	agent	138	27	Oh, by the way, when talking about the dough and preparing it in the pie shell. Make sure you choose the right material for the pie shell.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWad8g2rBEShErn7cc	user	47	9	my oven is fan-assisted so I need a temperature
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWaq0mM_271F67Tr6S	agent	80	17	When it is time to bake, you need to bake until 195°F (91°C) in the very center.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWaqrpsBRct_09RPC0	user	50	9	i would guess at 180C instead of conventional 200C
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWayT0_LrcVYFoRCPe	agent	42	10	OK so maybe you need to bake at 80°C then.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWb4oDqz-ScfqgBfE1	user	20	5	no, not 80C but 180C
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWbBlHzubPy9s5scUw	user	4	1	next
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWbHT79vyy2Ggj45rj	agent	69	12	Before going next, which material would you choose for the pie shell?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWbOVTGdWrtS7Yjq74	user	6	1	pastry
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWbXfxxI7CbN6BeIr9	agent	254	45	So for baking you need a glass pie shell.  Glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie. Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWb_7j4_OV2ic7wvD4	agent	319	58	Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWbiDATQnF_tJfEjTM	user	11	2	makes sense
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWbuSsd7qzlsxi0PIs	agent	115	21	Another thing I forgot to mention when tucking in the dough. It is important to keep those waves relaxed and loose.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWc0folfPYpbboanyl	user	38	6	I don't understand "relaxed and loose"
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcB-OYTHOgU7HS23p	agent	39	9	This means do not tuck it in too tight.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcCj6fnSPz5ewdneI	user	2	1	ok
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcDeilrNhj-fYSnna	user	4	1	next
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcHLdz9RJPNqKrMBi	agent	79	16	Reason is: a tighter crimp won't hold its shape as well with this style of pie.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcRgi6vf_Keh-mLer	agent	77	10	Another thing that's important here before proceeding. Refrigerating the pie!
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcX7f7wvHNmweXkRR	agent	42	9	What do you think, why should you do that?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcXqeHs_T6EFT7FEN	user	22	4	yes, that is mentioned
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWccRZrRYmcurHuVPh	user	45	8	so you get an event temperature before baking
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcjGfOIutnfmV2lz9	agent	213	38	Refrigerate the assembled pie at least 30 minutes, which is the perfect amount of time to preheat an oven to 400°F (200°C). Also, chilling ensures the dough is cold to start, which keeps the crust flaky and light.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWcmVlo9zm9ruhz5mf	agent	36	7	But now, let's proceed to step 4 ;-)
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWdTt-qb7EnkxHLgfm	user	10	2	looks easy
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWdZAHoDNem_lzZ7DA	agent	55	11	It is, but putting in the vents is very important here.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWdefEWy70rQXMgKiR	user	43	6	i understand that will provide  ventilation
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWdk8ecPyjyM9u2Zto	agent	188	36	Exactly!  Cut five or six large vents with a sharp knife, using the blade to open each one a little wider—when vents are cut too narrow, entrapped steam can make the top crust a bit mushy.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWdlmP2my3jM7KZRK_	agent	15	3	Just like this:
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWduLPu9cz0c75Ka4W	user	2	1	ok

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWeWxVzkY3zHYbu59a	user	27	4	no, it seems straighforward
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWecRfhWmcFgyit4OY	agent	34	7	OK, let's proceed to step number 5
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWeyu72I6p0RdCkmSL	user	35	7	what is an aluminum half sheet pan?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWf-r0sDGcKA89i8a2	agent	13	3	Let me see...
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWfJXHIjK0jbluX9E3	user	1	0	?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWfLrJkC4yN1U1gNi_	agent	13	3	Just a second
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWfTGq_TQx5lIoiWuQ	agent	630	109	while most of the stuff you encounter there will be oversize, you'll also find a ready supply of surprisingly tiny baking sheets. First, there are the quarter-sheet pans, which are, as you may have guessed, half the size of half sheets. Then there are the truly Lilliputian eighth sheets, half the size yet again. Those smallest ones measure a mere six and a half by nine and a half inches. For whatever reason, these smaller sheet pans rarely make their way into home kitchens. It's bizarre, because, as handy as they are in commercial kitchens, they're even more useful at home, where we routinely cook smaller portions of food.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWfX49yNfJ-_iFjIi-	agent	23	5	It's just a smaller pan

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWg1xOUctBY2G7TIvk	agent	114	19	Great! Oh, did you notice that 91°C is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWgLuPimJZzSTAAkrG	user	20	5	no I didn't but why?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWgTlzQGq-trPRFWSz	agent	430	71	Most fruit pie fillings are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie.  When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWhHj0-_Yyr66wMMw7	agent	13	3	Let me see...
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWhWomHPE43JlNw8Lb	agent	418	75	Hot apple pie fresh out of the oven might sound appealing, but letting it rest for a couple of hours will give you better results in the end. For one thing, most recipes are designed for optimum texture at room temperature. Slice that pie while it's too hot, and it'll be runny and wet instead of perfectly glazed and juicy. Pie crust also fares better at room temperature, where it'll have a flakier, crisper texture.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWhqQNQ56uVOH4ZamL	agent	15	3	Was it helpful?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWiH76UFCYm4ZzOxMB	user	24	4	yes, very helpul. thanks

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWiYZoN5rVwuR6wYvw	agent	309	52	Sure! Notice, however, that green apples are especially high in pectin, which means that even though this recipe doesn't use nearly as much starch as my other pies, the filling will thicken considerably as it cools. That only means that it's best served warm—something that's been true of apple pie all along.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWioHES63OMsA9CaNQ	user	46	10	yes, but will it keep  for longer in a fridge?
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWir0DyPvgDepwS4hK	agent	13	3	Let me see...

rfAHhxd	active	-NGWkM3CEL8SsW9ee7nB	agent	575	96	A fan-assisted oven allows a reduction in cooking temperature compared to a conventional oven. This comparison will vary, depending on factors including, for example, how much food is being cooked at once or if airflow is being restricted, for example by an oversized baking tray. This difference in cooking temperature is offset as the circulating air transfers heat more quickly than still air of the same temperature. In order to transfer the same amount of heat in the same time, the temperature must be lowered to reduce the rate of heat transfer in order to compensate.
rfAHhxd	active	-NGWkSPD-YWGb7cLHvX5	agent	92	17	But I can not tell you the exact temperature for this recipe when using a fan-assisted oven.

INfBowH	active	-NGqBMYlAZfzXzuBALg8	agent	40	8	Alright, let me show you the first step.
INfBowH	active	-NGqBSIq07L-fVwEnnkd	user	17	3	OK - What's next?
INfBowH	active	-NGqBb-J14GcwB2QVnDz	agent	92	18	At this step, be aware that for parisian gnocchi we use hot dough for a very special reason!
INfBowH	active	-NGqBg5BV3YBbBeJPFND	user	12	3	Why is that?
INfBowH	active	-NGqBjZTA0Z9Boaor6Z7	agent	15	4	Let me tell you
INfBowH	active	-NGqBlf55euCheAc9vNq	agent	173	27	Parisian gnocchi are somewhat of an oddity in the Western repertoire, in that they're made with a hot water dough—much like Chinese-style dumpling or stretched noodle dough.
INfBowH	active	-NGqBpjCpbTGUE2aQ15E	agent	369	60	With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it. There are two kinked proteins in flour, glutenin, and gliadin. Get them lubricated and rub them around enough through mechanical action (like kneading), and they tend to stretch out and bind with each other, forming the stretchy protein matrix known as gluten.
INfBowH	active	-NGqBsUAFkIGn_UdvJ7X	user	6	2	I see.
INfBowH	active	-NGqBt445jy_gI16nJ2T	agent	116	20	Gluten is what gives dough structure, and the more it's kneaded and worked, the tighter and more elastic it becomes.
INfBowH	active	-NGqBuG-J01678mfgaoP	user	4	1	Next
INfBowH	active	-NGqBwsiGNdvuvJghYgd	agent	371	63	A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.
INfBowH	active	-NGqC3ilZq9i8H8Fhpg_	agent	97	18	So this is why you need to add flour directly all at once to the saucepan. Intersting, right? :-)
INfBowH	active	-NGqC6SkxYqJbsXKxa3n	user	13	3	Yes, very so.
INfBowH	active	-NGqC7cu53xz71UxTQVy	user	10	2	Next step?
INfBowH	active	-NGqCA9Ft0AKJPVGTp0r	agent	5	1	Sure!
INfBowH	active	-NGqCIU-nWhtAxBWJtBn	user	53	10	Why mustard and cheese? What if I don't like mustard.
INfBowH	active	-NGqCLVK6ugAjQM_9syb	agent	13	3	Let me see...
INfBowH	active	-NGqCazTR26nFLQplQ9x	agent	182	32	After the basic dough is made, you can add some flavorings. Parmesan cheese is adding a savory backbone and helping the gnocchi to brown better down the line. That's the reason here.
INfBowH	active	-NGqCg_HLCQxr8IVRCKn	agent	46	11	But let me see what we can do with the mustard
INfBowH	active	-NGqCvERIuNhZV_RwIra	agent	108	19	Basically, a small dollop of Dijon mustard to the dough also adds some flavorings, as well as chopped herbs.
INfBowH	active	-NGqCxf7gpZvZmVHy81m	agent	41	6	Are you looking for mustard alternatives?
INfBowH	active	-NGqCzr69D6HaFIkH2di	user	12	2	Yes, please.
INfBowH	active	-NGqDPhtPVS9TiCgyT8n	agent	420	78	Hm so Dijon has a strong taste from the liquid they use in it (it's not quite vinegar, not quite wine).  I'd probably try a blend of some other mustard + a little white wine vinegar (not white vinegar; white wine vinegar) or champaigne vinegar or apple cider vinegar.  If you have dry mustard powder, and some time to let it sit, you could also try making your own; maybe that helps to make mustard taste better for you?
INfBowH	active	-NGqDXx4qMWoXU2HSUo5	user	28	7	OK - I will give this a try.
INfBowH	active	-NGqDZunWBevgEiU3_J1	user	22	5	What is the next step?

INfBowH	active	-NGqEl6C8K1cKRcyvu6G	user	4	2	I am
INfBowH	active	-NGqF5agYtV2FLRUOvy3	agent	348	54	Ok then you can actually do that by hand. If not, use a stand mixer.  Cooked side-by-side, there's absolutely no detectable difference between the wooden spoon and the stand-mixer method, provided you beat extremely vigorously. If you're even slightly lax with the hand-beating, then the stand mixer method will produce superior results every time.
INfBowH	active	-NGqFGyvP8UV72hHNBGz	user	41	9	OK - I have a wooden spoon. Will use that

INfBowH	active	-NGqGJsWgDEbhnduBlAf	agent	187	31	This will let it cool down slightly while allowing any vestiges of overworked gluten to relax and any under-hydrated starch to hydrate, helping the gnocchi to puff properly as they poach.

At this stage, they can be transferred to a sealed container and stored in the refrigerator for up to a few days until you're ready to fry or broil them just before serving.

INfBowH	active	-NGqHd7SoHf-3aib1xDH	agent	285	56	Not yet, but the goal is to pipe and cut as many gnocchi as you possibly can within about a minute, so that the last gnocchi that drops in won't be too far behind the first one that entered the pool. Once they've finished cooking, you fish them out and start again with the next batch.
INfBowH	active	-NGqHdpknhehm_cze_dO	agent	136	26	As you practice and your speed goes up, you should be able to pipe 30 to 40 gnocchi per minute, which greatly reduces overall prep time.

cegcgsG	active	-NGuo5Advhn60yuQo7Am	agent	13	3	Let me see...
cegcgsG	active	-NGuoRBxCxkoVaH7bQLq	agent	170	31	When making apple pie, you can use two different pie dough recipes, whether you like it old-fashioned and flaky or foolproof and tender. So it is a recipe, not a product.

cegcgsG	active	-NGupXNQzEYAcp8CMHmV	agent	103	19	Before going next, make sure to use the zip-top bag here. It is very important for the maceration step.
cegcgsG	active	-NGup_JWpslR7LFq9DC0	user	11	3	yes I know.
cegcgsG	active	-NGupe2RXHYG1uKx2WBy	agent	33	7	Why do you think it is important?
cegcgsG	active	-NGupho_B-tYGrW1Xexb	user	40	7	because otherwise it would be very messy
cegcgsG	active	-NGuppBqp5l1Pv56xwHE	agent	186	31	Exactly! Not only does this minimize cleanup down the road, it limits the fruit's exposure to air, meaning less oxidation, and it lets you toss everything together without making a mess.
cegcgsG	active	-NGupqU2L52PfYZsz7kH	agent	107	18	A five-quart-capacity bowl will do the same thing, but that will also increase the fruit's exposure to air.
cegcgsG	active	-NGuptZ5_iZYxDU50fdU	agent	32	8	But let's go on to the next step
cegcgsG	active	-NGuq25-MAVilP69spJK	user	32	5	what exactly does macerate mean?
cegcgsG	active	-NGuq61ldA1Hc_ZjsyfG	agent	43	7	Very interesting question!  Let me tell you
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqNBvM_3Hd8_bfNVB	agent	553	90	Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking. Maceration is the "magic" (really science) of applied osmotic pressure. The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher. If water is needed, it would be added after maceration, in those recipes.)
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqTFHr0EOYWUI7pJ-	agent	36	8	It should look like this in the end:
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqWbQ3kTInLuInrKU	user	51	9	ok thanks.  I've done similar with salt and lemons.
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqYO8n82_MKA21ntT	agent	214	38	The liquid you see after macerating the apples is a syrup composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. ( The mixture weighs little more than the brown sugar added in step one.)
cegcgsG	active	-NGuq_qaozkjmakDFMnJ	agent	208	41	yeah right! This is more or less the same thing that happens with my fresh lemon syrup, in which dry lemon rinds are tossed with seven ounces of sugar to yield a scant eight ounces of syrup after a few hours.
cegcgsG	active	-NGuq_wGMyoOrPvPjOjH	user	4	1	next
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqdsnbwhmL_vNhmwO	agent	23	5	Alright, this is Step 3
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqlzo5drWDSzx7Bwh	user	35	7	Does the starch act as a thickener?
cegcgsG	active	-NGuqrGXQ_ucFRM7aXw6	agent	51	10	Thank you for the question. I'll explain it to you.
cegcgsG	active	-NGur5CMcRyJyxkTo4WY	agent	426	73	Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose, while the overall water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch. Once the apples have collapsed by a third, you can add the tapioca starch, then seal the whole thing back up to toss around until it's well combined. Waiting to add the tapioca starch prevents it from interfering with maceration.
cegcgsG	active	-NGur6Y4cGTvJcgeiCX7	agent	20	4	Will look like this:
cegcgsG	active	-NGurG5MyczEIlmt2e9R	user	50	8	So the starch stops it from deteriorating further?
cegcgsG	active	-NGurUnrw2WNKQYS8uP5	agent	13	3	Let me see...
cegcgsG	active	-NGurxTmtk9Ia78KtT2m	agent	319	55	Adding the starch pulls the liquid out of the apples, concentrates the flavor in extracted juice, and then preserves the shape of the fruit during baking. It also reduces the chance of your pie boiling over during baking, and prevents empty space inside the pie under the crust. So yes, it prevents deteriorating a bit.

cegcgsG	active	-NGusS_ZcmdFgNnFeejH	user	29	7	why couldn't I use a pie tin?
cegcgsG	active	-NGusXPorNbKoO2IAC6F	agent	532	94	Glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.

cegcgsG	active	-NGusrW9yg37mg1bueBX	agent	112	22	Just keep those waves relaxed and loose, as a tighter crimp won't hold its shape as well with this style of pie.

cegcgsG	active	-NGut3Sv1D33cMBtPVfQ	user	47	8	Because the pastry could melt into the mixture?
cegcgsG	active	-NGutBnmo4nftNNNWw3n	agent	91	16	Almost. Chilling ensures the dough is cold to start, which keeps the crust flaky and light.

cegcgsG	active	-NGutNLlEQh1FsmQBMRg	user	39	8	I suppose the vents let the air escape?
cegcgsG	active	-NGutYn8G_g-WhV3d_-s	agent	198	38	Exactly. You should cut five or six large vents with a sharp knife, using the blade to open each one a little wider—when vents are cut too narrow, entrapped steam can make the top crust a bit mushy.

cegcgsG	active	-NGuuFktpY_DnpK-15Ck	agent	305	54	Yes it is almost the same. Parchment paper and baking paper are cellulose-based papers that have been treated or coated to make them non-stick. They are used in baking as a disposable non-stick surface. They should not be confused with wax paper or waxed paper, which is paper that has been coated in wax.

cegcgsG	active	-NGuumG4emcQpsiiwwlg	agent	382	62	Not really.  But it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie.  When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie.  A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.
cegcgsG	active	-NGuupjQ8cN8S4i4Ls8R	user	9	2	ok thanks
cegcgsG	active	-NGuuqubdr1S3gqn70_Q	agent	18	3	But let's proceed.
cegcgsG	active	-NGuv26TkbauGwUinDqW	user	88	20	I suppose you let it cool as it would be too hot to eat and it lets the contents settle?
cegcgsG	active	-NGuv6pZ3xSAOD8THjCD	agent	13	3	Let me see...
cegcgsG	active	-NGuvblPA35ZsLubYSEa	agent	220	43	So you need to wait for it to cool substantially before cutting or a pile of warm juicy fruit will spill out instead of coming out in a perfect slice. Apple pie is best at room temperature or chilled down to cold anyway.
cegcgsG	active	-NGuveb2Y4r-K6hXQbAR	agent	308	51	Another interesting fact:  Green apples are especially high in pectin, which means that even though this recipe doesn't use nearly as much starch as my other pies, the filling will thicken considerably as it cools. That only means that it's best served warm—something that's been true of apple pie all along.

tLrorpH	active	-NGv_u2keZwqDgtTYA_n	agent	15	4	Let me tell you
tLrorpH	active	-NGvaGuQ_xGu5Bn9gKm0	agent	408	67	Making a soufflé consists of multiple steps you need to follow. You will learn the trips and tricks in our masterclass.  Soufflé anxiety, or "soufflanxiety," as it's clinically known, is very much a real thing, suffered by millions of cooks all over the world. Anyone worried about a catastrophic soufflé collapse needs to find something else to fret about, because there's nothing hard about soufflé at all.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvaGvmnjfOvcDnfijI	user	23	5	what is the first step?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvaKFxbr6kQLPL_atG	agent	139	24	But the key are surely the eggs.  A soufflé is a fundamentally simple thing that leverages the power of eggs to achieve impressive results.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvaM3IlbIrhHPFfY9Z	agent	34	8	So let me show you the first step.

tLrorpH	active	-NGvbio4JVv5giH_JJiu	agent	139	23	Sure! When you grate some Parmigiano-Reggiano to dust the interior of the buttered soufflé dish, it helps to form a delicious crispy crust.

tLrorpH	active	-NGvd8ZKH9ZuNcrqgBuX	agent	153	27	I cannot tell you an exact temperature, but high quality butter only needs to be lightly warmed to melt. Also your butter can melt through friction heat.

tLrorpH	active	-NGvdXKrGxXvTXspXfkN	agent	15	4	Let me tell you
tLrorpH	active	-NGvdjtKufR6C-l7pHUK	agent	74	13	Friction causes heat, which can speed up the melting process of the butter
tLrorpH	active	-NGvduaFS1oKX78WQBoO	user	60	13	why do I need to add milk bit by bit rather than altogether?
tLrorpH	active	-NGve8wwI5JHUbXmPMpJ	agent	36	5	Interesting question!  Let me see...
tLrorpH	active	-NGveb29BegV786dfHat	agent	152	26	In savory soufflés, like the cheese soufflé here, the base is a thick béchamel sauce, usually calling for about three tablespoons flour per cup of milk.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvei1088XgZNG66u98	agent	56	13	Let me also tell you the reason why adding it bit by bit
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfEUQRLPTeKmT6YbN	agent	119	21	So béchamel is a flour-thickened milk-based sauce. You need to add it bit by bit to loosen up the butter-flour mixture.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfQ0TQAB_oPPpxW4l	user	33	7	Ok. What is the next step please?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfYIVYBQLMGR6atYx	agent	118	20	Just one thing to notice here. It's important to correctly balance out the amount of flour for soufflé béchamel sauces
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfci_8CewfcopdHJy	user	17	5	How do I do that?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfjpbHZZA352FLB02	agent	610	113	You have some room to play with a soufflé, a little more or less flour in your béchamel, maybe, or slightly different oven settings, but stray too far and you've left camp soufflé and veered into other territory. Add too much more flour, for example, and your soufflé is going to start to resemble a cake; too little and it'll be too thin to hold its shape, spilling up and over the sides of its container. In this recipe the amount of flour in the béchamel is leaning toward the high end of what's generally called for. It makes a soufflé that rises just a little less dramatically, but it still rises plenty.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfogFje072YIsQ7zh	agent	33	7	Do you want to hear more details?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvfrbydgagempXNPsu	user	10	2	Yes please
tLrorpH	active	-NGvg-qSQgAf4DZdkpOA	agent	297	59	As I said, it makes a soufflé that rises just a little less dramatically. In exchange, it has a bit more substance, which is what I like about it; a savory soufflé should feel like a meal, not a magic trick that puffs itself up before your eyes only to fade away and never make it to your stomach.

tLrorpH	active	-NGvhDncouTBwCH1Jj4-	agent	13	3	Let me see...
tLrorpH	active	-NGvhvNETKqnphkjItVI	agent	57	8	Simmering causes evaporation which thickens the sauce up.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvi54gtycDFQywpAUt	user	49	11	I see. Thank you. Shall we move to the next step?

tLrorpH	active	-NGviVQDQLE_6-UtSG7C	user	34	6	What does the whisking process do?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvidiUoweoBPn1lg3G	agent	256	46	Great question! The egg yolks get whisked in for even more richness, and, when in the oven, coagulation—as the eggs cook, they set, just like when you fry or scramble them, allowing the soufflé to hold onto its loft for at least some time before deflating.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvio4gft9sz46Ketew	user	48	10	Great to know, thank you. What is the next step?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvirohCa4Z3bFcmUvg	agent	14	4	This is step 5
tLrorpH	active	-NGviyrNv1uv1b-opuI-	user	64	12	What happens to the egg whites that turns them into stiff peaks?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvjC9xmgEF300AuyNg	agent	37	6	Interesting question! Let me tell you
tLrorpH	active	-NGvjl16iypLLpgu8HfE	agent	348	63	When beating egg whites, they are classified in three stages according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and stiff peaks. Overbeaten eggs take on a dry appearance, and eventually collapse. Egg whites do not beat up correctly if they are exposed to any form of fat, such as cooking oils or the fats contained in egg yolk.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvjtAO38kKd0dgsfGW	agent	169	29	At this stage, egg whites stirred in more aggressively to loosen the base enough to accept the second addition, which should be gently folded in without too much effort.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvk-ZPZtWlyb2nlBdR	user	28	5	what is the second addition?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvkDqydiPas4r4debA	agent	539	100	In the second addition gentle folding is key, since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them. That's what causes a soufflé to rise, and really, there's no stopping it—your beaten whites will contain air bubbles and those air bubbles will expand, and when they do your soufflé will push higher and higher in its baking dish.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvkLJX8F52qaEjbXh5	user	29	5	This really helps, thank you.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvkOLA_8fFuUYMSGdZ	agent	376	65	A whisking method by a famous French chef is the following: first beating quickly to loosen the whites before slowing down to aerate them, lifting the whites with the whisk and letting them splash back down on themselves without tapping the bowl too much with the tines, a whisking movement that's different (and easier) than the figure eight often used to beat cream by hand.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvkiQN-mi9fY67auxz	user	33	7	great tip! what is the next step?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvkqeetHtQzyK349oP	user	34	7	why should I use a silicon spatula
tLrorpH	active	-NGvkua3aReFb1fRmuny	agent	13	3	Let me see...
tLrorpH	active	-NGvlJVJ7qFYEHDJOgRU	agent	415	65	Silicone spatulas have become increasingly common in recent years. Silicone is heat-resistant at much higher temperatures—around 600°F (315°C), depending on whom you ask, as opposed to a ceiling under 400°F (200°C) for most nylon spatulas—flexible, and as nonstick as Teflon itself.  Also some people find that a silicone spatula is frequently better at getting the pan clean than a stiff spatula like a wooden one.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvlg30E-oeKURLm7MF	user	29	6	Great. What is the next step?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvlpeiN_-8egcYhDMT	agent	77	14	Will show you in a second. Notice that mixing in Gruyère is important here...
tLrorpH	active	-NGvm1Sov7QQRA1FVJ_Q	user	20	4	Why is it important?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvm87AvjuJdhR1646R	agent	248	45	So basically you can use various types of cheese, but a flavorful, good melter like Gruyère or cheddar is ideal.  You want a good melter with a low water content. That means a semifirm cheese that can be grated into shreds, like Gruyère or cheddar.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvmHCIeDZY5mUn-Naj	agent	47	10	Keep that in mind :-) Now let's move to step 7.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvmhMicM3sm2RXzU73	user	49	10	how much is the souffle mixture going to rise by?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvn-XvvM8VuGyQcMwB	agent	94	16	That depends on multiple factors like the oven temperature and how the egg whites were beaten.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvnXrs_iylN-3KwtdF	user	91	20	So I should leave about 1 cm from the top of the ramekin free so that the souffle can rise?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvnrP0bvhA3MYlUJYe	agent	48	10	I'm sorry I do not have answer for this question

tLrorpH	active	-NGvohemEX2Ed6s-dadI	agent	54	10	So 350°F are roughly 176°C and 400°F are roughly 204°C
tLrorpH	active	-NGvopzXeyr32galHWPC	agent	98	18	This is one of the most important steps. The temperature affects the success of the soufflé a lot.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvp-pW3_PoVqHwYwXe	user	68	12	In which way does the temperature affect the success of the soufflé?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvpAYacZ7dKMHLYiBS	agent	823	146	First, the heat of the oven is a critical "ingredient" for getting a soufflé to rise; it's what causes gases to expand inside all those trapped air bubbles and what converts moisture in the soufflé batter to steam. Together, those forces expand the air bubbles and cause the soufflé to swell. The hotter the oven, the more quickly and fully the soufflé will rise, and the faster it will brown and set on the outside. The heat also sets the proteins in the egg yolks and whites, allowing the soufflé to keep some of its height even after cooling. Without the eggs setting, the soufflé batter would remain liquid and would immediately collapse back down to its original state as soon as it cooled. Lastly, the heat browns the surface of the soufflé, giving it a deeper flavor, thanks to our good friend the Maillard reaction.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvpREz8-UHBL9ooiTk	agent	98	16	For example, an oven temperature of 350°F or 400°F influences the soufflé in two different ways...
tLrorpH	active	-NGvq0v2i-zpY5uk7gMr	user	30	5	What is the Maillard reaction?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvqAuj9wqfLszPM0hu	user	89	16	What are the two different ways an oven temperature of 350 or 400F influence the souffle?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvqCQiDTwvj86Od2-5	agent	15	4	Let me tell you
tLrorpH	active	-NGvqY1rho1N0jEtgHLG	agent	658	106	The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic reaction. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the amine group of a free amino acid and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar, usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry, since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvq_yfdK_J_LqDjrIi	agent	26	3	Regarding the temperature:
tLrorpH	active	-NGvqj5vgV_lEW90GPbh	agent	572	108	A 400°F oven produced a marginally taller soufflé than a 375°F oven did.  But the soufflé is also more likely to remain runny in the center, since it'd come close to burning on the outside if you were to leave it long enough to cook through to the center.  If you use a lower oven temperature, like 350°F or 375°F, you'll get slightly less of a rise, and the soufflé will brown on the outside more slowly.  That buys you time to leave the soufflé in the oven longer, letting it cook through more fully to the center with less risk that the surface blackens in the process.

tLrorpH	active	-NGvrEX4HMcXrzID6GQt	user	49	10	how long does it take for the souffle to deflate?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvrVNzFY2VEzOyezHK	agent	423	80	Good quesiton. As a general rule, the faster and more dramatic the rise of the soufflé, the more catastrophic the fall. A lower oven temperature and stiffer mix will give a slower rise and a slower fall. You can also use a water bath to control the temperature of the soufflé as it cooks.You can always re-puff a soufflé by re-heating it, but it will just fall again, and it will not rise as high each time it is re-heated.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvrgeDksaju8EvRQgR	user	42	7	Great stuff. And who invented the soufflé?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvrq8PRGMLBVaBnjDY	agent	263	40	The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook. Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century.
tLrorpH	active	-NGvrxN6FuCNK1m5puoJ	user	55	10	Is the cheese souffle the most popular type of souffle?
tLrorpH	active	-NGvsOgdDCGsQHh2sTY6	agent	595	95	I don't know which type of soufflé is more popular, but usually you differ between savory and sweet soufflé. There are a number of both savory and sweet soufflé flavor variations. Savory soufflés often include cheese, and vegetables such as spinach, carrot and herbs, and may sometimes incorporate poultry, bacon, ham, or seafood for a more substantial dish. Sweet soufflés may be based on a chocolate or fruit sauce (lemon or raspberry, for example), and are often served with a dusting of powdered sugar. Frugal recipes sometimes emphasize the possibilities for making soufflés from leftovers.

An alternative would be to make a Beef or veal since those bones give up enough gelatin to make a truly spectacular sauce.

1vNO49Y	active	-NKI9zmYd_k6KkEuUK1-	agent	347	60	Precisely.   Unlike a chicken, which has delicate white meat that reaches kindling-level dryness north of 155°F, and beef, which is loaded with loins that turn to jerky at high heat, duck is one of those special creatures whose every part is just as delicious served well-done as pink. More precisely,  If the skin is great, the duck will be, too.
1vNO49Y	active	-NKIA6h7wCDfewjALOFE	agent	133	23	In this context, blanching the birds in boiling water first, and pricking the skin all over, can help the fat render more completely.
1vNO49Y	active	-NKIAAE6MnTjGv_HDlYe	user	25	5	it also tightens the skin
1vNO49Y	active	-NKIAJ8dSY16EQlWOEdL	agent	243	39	Correct! You truly are an expert!  As you mentioned, blanching also helps set the bird into picture-perfect form; the skin tightens in the hot water, and because the duck is buoyant, any potentially asymmetrical effects of gravity are negated.

1vNO49Y	active	-NKIDArvMlQrZuTv6UER	user	54	11	isn't it something to do with fat content of the bird?
1vNO49Y	active	-NKIDHOULwMFx5c5Hheq	agent	393	66	Wow! That is correct! Duck handles high heat so well for two reasons.  First, the meat all over is on the darker side, giving it a richer, oilier texture that can better withstand the drying effects of high temperatures. Second, and even more important, is the duck's luxuriously fatty skin, which insulates the meat and bathes it in mouth-coating rendered fat, ensuring each bite is unctuous.
1vNO49Y	active	-NKIDKZt8G5r1b8OYI-q	agent	109	22	This is, in the end, great news, because what it means is that it's really, really hard to ruin a roast duck.

1vNO49Y	active	-NKIE6qtvaX8q60YmGqb	agent	225	41	That is correct.  A gastrique is a sweet-sour mixture of caramel and wine vinegar, added in small doses to a sauce to flavor it. When done right, the acidity is bright and sharp, but lightly rounded out by the darkened sugar.

1vNO49Y	active	-NKIEVCBYc8M9GJsx7O5	agent	431	79	Before proceeding to the next step, let me give you a tip on how to make this sauce.  A much, much better approach is to use the wet technique for making a caramel.  You basically add water to the sugar first, which wets and dissolves it, speeding up the caramelization process while helping to prevent scorching.  The water cooks off as the mixture boils and it's clear to the eye when the caramel reaches a nice deep amber color.
1vNO49Y	active	-NKIEYGDSCgPLBl7cofK	agent	89	17	At this point, you can add the vinegar in very small additions, gently swirling as you do

ea5def48	active	-NKXqNcMHrcmzE5o62vZ	agent	45	10	Sure! Would you like to go to the first step?
ea5def48	active	-NKXqPl3srVRhBYPFEzp	user	4	1	Yes.
ea5def48	active	-NKXqWz5wuWYAxtF1G2I	user	26	5	How long should that take?
ea5def48	active	-NKXqaZmnOYY1WOCWAla	agent	54	10	I'm not sure I understand you.  Can you rephrase this?
ea5def48	active	-NKXqjtXF6AEP57YnLfY	user	85	18	In the picture you say I should pound the garlic to a paste. How long does that take?
ea5def48	active	-NKXr1V_Dx4x5Rg9h1Q8	agent	106	22	It should not take long. The goal is to pound the garlic into a rough paste as shown in the picture below.
ea5def48	active	-NKXr5wBADgZvuB3l7TB	user	30	6	So it should be really creamy?
ea5def48	active	-NKXrSgOzMmXjz_x0k-V	agent	159	30	Not very creamy. Once you add the pine nuts and smack them down into crumbled bits, you should obtain a sticky beige paste when you grind them with the garlic.
ea5def48	active	-NKXrUCBxz_xdB4laxDF	agent	25	6	let me show you a picture
ea5def48	active	-NKXryyPyiwOTN0e5LFE	user	95	19	Why does this picture not appear in the big picture section. Not so easy to see in this thread.
ea5def48	active	-NKXsAm8HS_ZqJpCW0wK	agent	21	4	I'm sorry about that.
ea5def48	active	-NKXsHEGDPkc-gp7TKtc	agent	49	9	But a great suggestion for a new feature! Thanks!
ea5def48	active	-NKXsTmJLsvXN3ttYTRg	user	247	46	One question I wanted to ask: pine nuts are very expensive and I appreciate that the genuine pesto uses them. I have seen that commercial pestos use cashews. Can then be used as a substitute and what is the consequence for taste of the final dish?
ea5def48	active	-NKXsqWNyg7jBrpn0xD2	agent	172	31	That is a great question!  As you mentioned most recipes for pesto sauce call for pine nuts, but walnuts are not unheard of. So the flavour will only be affected marginally
ea5def48	active	-NKXsyzyHBSPkJ7uy3xr	user	37	8	Thank you. So, what is the next step?
ea5def48	active	-NKXt35KvJkEX55dxFer	agent	71	14	It's also worth noting that toasting nuts in this step is not worth it.
ea5def48	active	-NKXt8ABQMy0jmSWBEyn	agent	29	7	Let me show you the next step
ea5def48	active	-NKXtQG220ALOm7PIHZt	user	30	5	Yes, so more arm exercises ;-)
ea5def48	active	-NKXtUL0hnRRnw4RouZh	agent	35	7	Exactly! But it will be worth it :)
ea5def48	active	-NKXteQR9x0u2bo31keV	agent	38	9	Would you like to go to the next step?
ea5def48	active	-NKXtgZrm-zmR7vzPd6N	user	11	2	Yes please.
ea5def48	active	-NKXtx_QxRJ5jRackGdP	user	87	18	So I have to make sure that each handful is ground down properly before I add the next?
ea5def48	active	-NKXuBLaKBij0WeicK2_	agent	129	24	Yes exactly! Adding small pinches of coarse sea salt is helpful here as salt acts as an abrasive that helps break down the basil.
ea5def48	active	-NKXuKqnSsNtEGQieYd7	agent	125	22	In this step, I would also recommend washing the basil leaves just before crushing the leaves against the side of the mortar.
ea5def48	active	-NKXudPHrcmp41jjG9zd	user	112	21	In the list of ingredients it stated that the basil should be washed, but that water should still cling to them.
ea5def48	active	-NKXuglIY_Z6w32KEfg1	user	22	5	Is this a second wash?
ea5def48	active	-NKXukXHNiwuIHXj86Z-	agent	132	24	Precisely! If you wash the basil leaves just before and leave the water clinging to them, it helps to build up this creamy emulsion.
ea5def48	active	-NKXuoCjJRWHFPWs5dq_	agent	40	9	And no, you just need to wash them once.
ea5def48	active	-NKXv11kPRui71GTO8CY	user	132	25	I was going to say that there is a colour change from dark to light green. Is that an indication of the emulsion  process happening?
ea5def48	active	-NKXvIrVwQyJM-uAZ_jd	agent	103	16	Yes exactly! You should end up with a beautiful light-green paste that's creamy, almost like guacamole.
ea5def48	active	-NKXvMvCsDeF5EQvEAl5	agent	174	29	During this process I would recommend adding the olive oil in small increments, working it in with the pestle to maintain that creamy emulsion before adding the next handful.
ea5def48	active	-NKXvW9jTvxX-K_1KXAJ	user	62	11	That makes sense because otherwise the mixture gets a bit dry.
ea5def48	active	-NKXvipJ5X7Ne0AefbmB	agent	65	13	By the way, you could also use a food processor for this process.
ea5def48	active	-NKXvwu_A-3ap_ydAvEX	user	72	15	Ah, that is a question I wanted to ask. Is there an different in result?
ea5def48	active	-NKXwL3KgrHRt-fgSFOg	user	137	25	Sorry, typo: Is there any difference in result if you use the 'lazy' method, i.e. the food processor? Other than the halo around my head?
ea5def48	active	-NKXwdeoeGcFdkcDgP9j	agent	384	63	That is a great question! Yes, there is quite an important difference which becomes evident once you put the pesto sauce on the pasta.  The mortar-and-pestle pesto coats the noodles beautifully, bathing them in a gorgeous green-tinted sauce. By contrast, the food processor pesto just sticks to the pasta in little bits, like glitter, and the oil absorbs little of the basil's colour.
ea5def48	active	-NKXwpPwEJBEx8lGrDDd	agent	133	25	Hence, the best pesto should be made under the pressure of a pestle. However, the food processor is a good alternative if in a hurry.
ea5def48	active	-NKXwxlZ_Nee1USinN3V	user	49	11	I will go for the halo then ;-). So what is next.
ea5def48	active	-NKXxHpN34kEUj1v-s-_	user	84	15	Is this speed of adding the olive oil important, just like when you make mayonnaise?
ea5def48	active	-NKXxYH_2uME7EbYe66j	agent	123	24	No in this context it does not matter as long as you add the olive oil in small increments to maintain the creamy emulsion.
ea5def48	active	-NKXxsbJVbrCH1TjrEc4	user	48	11	Do I now taste it and add more salt if required?
ea5def48	active	-NKXyF6viEM3gLL2BZQ9	agent	75	14	Yes, you should always taste it as you adjust the ratio of the ingredients.
ea5def48	active	-NKXyJS3zhcjTCXj4-JY	user	18	4	No pepper in this?
ea5def48	active	-NKXyOv266ym_pqGgY3F	agent	40	7	No, pepper is not a required ingredient.
ea5def48	active	-NKXybxTrJQax30hhTJ7	agent	48	9	Have you managed to find the Ligurian olive oil?
ea5def48	active	-NKXyimEMuKdOxBcX1qZ	user	28	5	It was far too expensive :-(
ea5def48	active	-NKXypzO4pOS_sYk3QZt	user	42	9	Does it have a major  impact on the taste?
ea5def48	active	-NKXyvLR-lPEmKwF5b0l	agent	10	3	Yes it is!
ea5def48	active	-NKXyyIYCOJLs4-Y7xU_	agent	105	21	No not really. As long as you're using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good.
ea5def48	active	-NKXz5K2fd-zcmhiP65t	user	62	10	How does this recipe compare to the commercial ones available?
ea5def48	active	-NKXz9s2PgC9rMtmAFDC	agent	49	10	I'm sorry, I do not think I have this information
ea5def48	active	-NKXzN_xUfTAtdpkki66	user	59	11	Yea, that is obviously a matter of taste. Sorry for asking.
ea5def48	active	-NKXz_KSpMSFo0QLd6C1	user	45	8	Is this the real 'original' recipe for pesto?
ea5def48	active	-NKXzfg09eFqqLy7dSWP	agent	114	24	Don't worry about it! I'm here to help you to make the best pesto so feel free to ask any question you might have!
ea5def48	active	-NKXzvk6bI7NeiwrTNUS	agent	184	31	This recipe closely follows the original pesto recipe.  The most famous, and the one we're talking about here, is pesto alla genovese, from the Ligurian city of Genoa and its environs.
ea5def48	active	-NKY-1gXoaC-b9Vu6Oz0	agent	151	25	However, notice that Pesto is a more generic Italian term that describes a wide variety of puréed sauces, traditionally made using a mortar and pestle.
ea5def48	active	-NKY-3nbgVyYRT1RUgtb	agent	212	31	There are other pesto sauces worth knowing about, though, including Sicily’s blushing-red pesto alla trapanese, which is rich with tomatoes; southern France's pistou (a version without nuts); and many, many more.
ea5def48	active	-NKY-Q5K7dAcZ72ne2mK	user	51	11	Wow, I did not realise this. I had heard of pistou.
ea5def48	active	-NKY-vZi9TXis6O0Z-Ij	agent	38	9	Would you like to go to the last step?
ea5def48	active	-NKY-w6YDp7fvdS1vfSd	user	152	31	But back to our pesto. After adjusting the salt I assume we have completed the dish. How long before using it can I make it? Does it keep in the fridge?
ea5def48	active	-NKY03YpQzsG7pFWd4Ja	agent	46	9	Yes, precisely, let me show you the last step.
ea5def48	active	-NKY0FkxncK71jAhaTXV	user	61	11	That looks delicious and so different from the stuff in jars.
ea5def48	active	-NKY0UJl5QMaMx1WUusr	user	47	10	How long can/could I keep it? Can it be frozen?
ea5def48	active	-NKY0oe5e6Tyixe-Kx6D	agent	26	7	Let me see what I can find
ea5def48	active	-NKY1gpV-py-xywqwfTS	agent	271	49	So making pesto and freezing it doesn't work well due to the Parmesan cheese component. You could get around this by making a mix of the chopped/blended basil and olive oil, and freezing that combination. With that, you may also be able to add your salt & garlic as well.
ea5def48	active	-NKY1tj5_Yv8GqpK0XEK	agent	77	15	however, I'm not sure for how long you should be able to keep it refrigerated
ea5def48	active	-NKY29MPvlWw2KOcscIm	user	145	28	Thank you. Sounds like freezing it would be an expensive mistake after all the work. So one must not make more than required that or the net day.
ea5def48	active	-NKY2EJc220eMiiTl_aw	agent	10	1	Precisely!
ea5def48	active	-NKY2LwhTNlmdqG5Vk7s	agent	95	18	This was the last step in the recipe. Feel free to ask any additional questions you might have.
ea5def48	active	-NKY2e33s6e57pMWJxhu	user	49	9	Thank you very much. Great info and very helpful.

c70f521	active	-NKdBmrUlg7Gf1BtVOtB	agent	125	23	I'm sorry, I do not think I have an answer to your question. However, it's recommended to use fresh parsley leaves and chives
c70f521	active	-NKdBq_yleYRDG_w7C2D	user	4	1	Okay
c70f521	active	-NKdBvdcgOOjxOaz9K9A	agent	45	8	Are you also planning to use   Dijon mustard?
c70f521	active	-NKdBx3jAlo3hri66437	user	3	1	Yes
c70f521	active	-NKdC2cP-BYawUubm4w6	agent	109	21	Ok great! Do you have any other question regarding the ingredients or would you like to go to the first step?
c70f521	active	-NKdC6TlEtjQZQyUMWfx	user	26	6	Let's go to the first step
c70f521	active	-NKdC8Wdf8sBVB2tJUyu	agent	5	1	Sure!
c70f521	active	-NKdCSb_4UvUYQBzujVC	agent	84	16	Can you tell me what is the difference between hot water dough and cold water dough?
c70f521	active	-NKdCYacLvvT9TYWw0LT	user	7	2	No idea
c70f521	active	-NKdCn-PwSaWlSKnfyi_	user	29	6	I'm ready for the second step
c70f521	active	-NKdCzlTnUqReo3uhVmr	agent	380	70	Well that's fine!  With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it.  A ball of well-kneaded cold water dough will spring back if you press it and contract if you stretch it. This is why, for example, pizza dough is extremely hard to roll out until it's had at least a couple hours to rest and allow this gluten to relax.
c70f521	active	-NKdD1vMRvPhk8fQNOcg	agent	371	63	A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.
c70f521	active	-NKdD3hHObIq_jXRQ7ka	agent	112	21	As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple, kind of like Play-Do.
c70f521	active	-NKdDPAF7tM4MJQKY3x6	user	12	1	Interesting.
c70f521	active	-NKdDXzuKb-pRhIPUzMB	agent	33	8	Ok let me show you the next step.
c70f521	active	-NKdDgHkJIgQ6jhlfeGi	agent	38	8	Are you planning to use a stand mixer?
c70f521	active	-NKdDi32QdVJHY-Y1DiB	user	9	3	Yes, I am
c70f521	active	-NKdDx5ntz_wyH0MkkYq	agent	303	42	That's great!  Cooked side-by-side, there's absolutely no detectable difference between the wooden spoon and the stand-mixer method, provided you beat extremely vigorously. However,  If you're even slightly lax with the hand-beating, then the stand mixer method will produce superior results every time.
c70f521	active	-NKdDziY52XOTrFL56Bw	user	32	7	What kind of cheese are we using
c70f521	active	-NKdE6FXx6FPMDzxdx0q	agent	85	16	In this recipe we are using 1/2 cup (about 1 ounce) of freshly grated Parmesan cheese
c70f521	active	-NKdEFhO_xYrxdyUiXze	user	39	8	I just bought a stand mixer for myself.
c70f521	active	-NKdELx4iQ26_kKg-HMR	user	28	5	Got it.  Freshly grated parm
c70f521	active	-NKdESwK2KJLWKm26QU1	agent	57	10	Perfect! Do you have any other questions about this step?
c70f521	active	-NKdEZXKe9HKg4W8oLbm	user	34	6	No, everything's going well so far
c70f521	active	-NKdEgNOFgL0JMO4o1hu	agent	30	7	Ok perfect! Let's go to step 4
c70f521	active	-NKdEpQePdQvjibcZoHG	agent	105	20	in this step, it's very important that you let the mixture rest for 15 to 25 minutes at room temperature.
c70f521	active	-NKdEsJLiVjvcs5M4zXr	user	4	1	okay
c70f521	active	-NKdF6Vi18JDdKxMUnyM	user	62	13	Why do you need to stop cutting off the mixture in one minute?
c70f521	active	-NKdFCLxMcaQINTDJH1v	agent	186	38	The goal is to pipe and cut as many gnocchi as you possibly can within about a minute, so that the last gnocchi that drops in won't be too far behind the first one that entered the pool.
c70f521	active	-NKdFOD1-ma8oYBlUsdN	user	94	18	Ah, I see.  Makes sense.  Then you wait until they are cooked, take them out, and start again?
c70f521	active	-NKdFSZinksc0M1-9Is_	agent	20	4	Yes, that is correct
c70f521	active	-NKdFbYy4Qyen8GZdQlf	user	39	7	How many gnocchi does this recipe make?

c70f521	active	-NKdHDRzhIqxchRKBESc	user	23	5	What is a metal spider?
c70f521	active	-NKdHO6W1g-5kcnCvAmY	agent	87	16	A "metal spider" is restaurant lingo for a flat mesh scoop used in frying and skimming.
c70f521	active	-NKdHZJiivHnb6N_jp1s	user	26	6	I don't have one of those.
c70f521	active	-NKdHnb_OxYfcDBvFDAX	agent	57	11	In that case, a relatively big strainer would do the job.
c70f521	active	-NKdHvbv9Ks4WmX0cLwr	user	31	8	Does it have to be a metal one?

4f7f5758	active	-NKiJ73tvVMMavJpZNI9	agent	108	20	If you want to make the very best pesto, I would recommend using a mortar and pestle from the Mediterranean.

4f7f5758	active	-NKiJt0xkaG_6sBjfqCk	agent	63	12	I would also recommend using the best fresh basil you can find.
4f7f5758	active	-NKiJyfPuu58tvAjPi-o	agent	210	38	And as long as you're using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good; if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.
4f7f5758	active	-NKiK6UlYg2IKn69fDJf	user	73	13	thanks for the tips! How about the Pecorino, the recipe states 'see note'
4f7f5758	active	-NKiKQVz0hGPdIsPaG33	agent	191	27	So,  historically, the cheeses of true Ligurian pesto were Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Sardo (or Fiore Sardo), a Sardinian sheep's-milk cheese. However, you can also use Pecorino Romano.
4f7f5758	active	-NKiKUFIVgcURy71wNLt	agent	84	14	But be careful as Pecorino Romano is saltier, sharper, and tangier than Fiore Sardo.

4f7f5758	active	-NKiLWOUiV0AD7AvZzek	agent	30	7	No, you can just add the nuts.
4f7f5758	active	-NKiLXXY1S6z6ZcG3I6e	agent	156	27	Additionally, in this step, I would not recommend toasting the nuts as the result is only marginally better and  I'm not sure most people would even notice.

4f7f5758	active	-NKiNshHBM9U-pwwABbM	agent	451	85	that is a great question!  A jar of pesto should be stored in the refrigerator after opening and lasts for two to three weeks, but it may start to lose flavor from the moment you open the jar.  However, make sure to check the colour of the leaves. Once they turn from green to brown, it is all over for the pesto.To boost the 'shelf-life' of the pesto in the fridge, make sure that it is completely covered with olive oil before sealing the container.

a9780bf6	active	-NKijqPkBUspSYeuYcsE	agent	311	53	With spatchcoking, you would get slightly less crisping on the skin over the breast, which is centered in a protective pocket of cooler air.  Spatchcocking also requires doing (easy enough with poultry shears, but not as easy as leaving the bird whole); and you lose that classic roast duck shape for the table.
a9780bf6	active	-NKijtAAv0FXBzNplX8F	agent	370	64	Step 2:  Trim away any excess skin around the duck's neck and cavity openings. Cut off duck wingettes and wing tips at the joint, leaving the drumettes connected to the duck; remove neck and any giblets from the cavity. Refrigerate trimmed wing ends, neck, and spine (if using) until ready to make the sauce; reserve giblets and trimmed skin for another use, or discard.

In a large pot of boiling water and while wearing heavy kitchen gloves to protect your hands from the heat, dip the duck into the water for 2 minutes. Remove, allowing boiling water to drain off before transferring duck, breast side up, to a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet.

Set trimmed wings and neck (plus backbone, if you've spatchcocked the duck) on a rimmed baking sheet along with the diced carrot, onion, and celery and drizzle lightly with oil, rubbing to coat all over; if using tomato paste (it will help darken an overly white stock), rub it all over the duck and vegetables as well.

a9780bf6	active	-NKimkGDiWC8dXX9oWXr	agent	387	64	That's correct!  Duck handles high heat so well for two reasons. First, the meat all over is on the darker side, giving it a richer, oilier texture that can better withstand the drying effects of high temperatures. Second, and even more important, is the duck's luxuriously fatty skin, which insulates the meat and bathes it in mouth-coating rendered fat, ensuring each bite is unctuous.

a9780bf6	active	-NKimxJCJ4ND_WCSFJmC	agent	384	72	Step 11:  Reduce oven to 300°F (150°C) and continue to roast duck until an instant-read thermometer registers around 175°F in the thickest parts of the thigh and breast, about 45 minutes if the duck is spatchcocked and 1 hour if whole (it's okay if some parts of the duck get hotter, it's meant to be well done and will not harm the duck). Remove duck from oven and set aside to rest.

a9780bf6	active	-NKip-IzfE3Kr7BcMMGU	agent	451	79	Step 13:  Remove from heat and add vinegar in very small increments while carefully swirling the saucepan; the caramel will boil and bubble violently at first, so adding the vinegar in very small amounts at first will help prevent a boil-over. Once the gastrique has calmed down, you can add the remaining vinegar more quickly, swirling the whole time. Some of the caramel may seize up at first, but it will dissolve back into the solution on its own.

tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSFsKW2vDAj6ymQY04	agent	263	40	The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century.
tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSG1kIBMGwPof_JSEV	user	38	7	what other types of souffle are there?
tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSG6M0QoVQeyBJpolJ	agent	554	90	There are a number of both savory and sweet soufflé flavor variations. Savory soufflés often include cheese, and vegetables such as spinach, carrot and herbs, and may sometimes incorporate poultry, bacon, ham, or seafood for a more substantial dish. Sweet soufflés may be based on a chocolate or fruit sauce (lemon or raspberry, for example), and are often served with a dusting of powdered sugar. Frugal recipes sometimes emphasize the possibilities for making soufflés from leftovers. A soufflé may be served alone or with ice cream, fruit, or a sauce.

tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSGNs8qJ-KPoizLrg4	agent	370	64	A soufflé is a baked egg-based dish which originated in early eighteenth century France. It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb "souffler" which means "to blow", "to breathe", "to inflate" or "to puff".

When served, the top of a soufflé may be punctured with serving utensils to separate it into individual servings. This can also enable a sauce to integrate into the dish.

tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBST4EdhYntXXMETtzd	agent	353	62	In confectionery and candy making, cream of tartar is commonly used as the acidulant, with typical amounts in the range of 0.15-0.25% of the sugar's weight. The use of cream of tartar imparts a honey-like flavor to the syrup. After the inversion is completed, it may be neutralized with baking soda using a weight of 45% of the cream of tartar's weight.
tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSTEKSpik73qmVWhwm	user	20	4	what is an acidulant
tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSTELXXIxtolBhtDSn	agent	175	31	For the soufflée, cream of tartar helps form more stable beaten whites that are less prone to breaking and weeping. It is an acid that also prevents sulfur bonds from forming.
tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSTH74plsCtiVfbGLm	user	8	3	oh i see
tcYis3RLgY	passive	-NBSTJ7al1vKa8YrzEaP	agent	388	61	Acidulants are chemical compounds that confer a tart, sour, or acidic flavor to foods. They differ from acidity regulators, which are food additives intended to modify the stability of food or enzymes within it. Typical acidulants are acetic acid (e.g. in pickles) and citric acid. Many beverages, such as colas, contain phosphoric acid. Sour candies often are formulated with malic acid.

h8x8QLzyCx	passive	-NBg02FNdLDR6myFmYtP	agent	270	44	There are really two types of gnocchi recipes: those made the old school, wooden-spoon-and-elbow-grease way, and those made with the mechanical aid of a stand mixer. The latter is also possible and probably easier, particularly if your beating arm is not quite in shape.

h8x8QLzyCx	passive	-NBg2RTAF0LkPhaJ8OSw	agent	589	106	So Parisian gnocchi are somewhat of an oddity in the Western repertoire, in that they're made with a hot water dough.  The beauty of a hot water dough is that it doesn't bounce back as much as a cold water dough does.  As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple, kind of like Play-Do. With our tender, easy-to-shape hot water dough, however, the stretching is easy, and, what's more, the gnocchi keep their stretched-out shape even after they begin to cool, ensuring that they stay light and tender no matter how we choose to finish them off.

He used the dough to make a gâteau and named it . Over time, the recipe of the dough evolved, and the name changed to , which was used to make, small cakes made in the shape of a woman's breasts. Then, Avice, in the eighteenth century, created what was then called choux buns. The name of the dough changed to , as Avice's buns resembled cabbages—"choux" in French. This pastry is used to make profiteroles, , éclairs, French crullers, St. Honoré cake, Parisian gnocchi, dumplings and gougères.

The name is also used in France in the dish known as "gnocchis à la parisienne", a hot dish comprising gnocchi formed of choux pastry served with Béchamel sauce. A specialty of Nice, the "gnocchi de tantifla a la nissarda", is made with potatoes, wheat flour, eggs and "blette" (Swiss chard), which is also used for the "tourte de blette". "La merda dé can" is longer than the original gnocchi.

coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBX9SEKsCvtDZIJNSws	agent	333	56	Pesto genovese is not the only authentic Italian pesto. Pesto rosso is made with sun-dried tomatoes and almonds, while versions from Southern Italy favor sweet red peppers or cherry tomatoes. What all traditional pestos have in common, and what defines a pesto as a pesto is that the ingredients are crushed with a mortar and pestle.
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBX9_sIifvSUGuXM1Uo	agent	128	23	The most famous, and the one we're talking about here, is pesto alla genovese, from the Ligurian city of Genoa and its environs.
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBX9ixfu0DjdA9iAsjY	user	62	12	Does the word pesto have something to do with the word pestle?
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBX9maSik5Er2m1cyRH	agent	13	3	Let me see...
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXA8VfNWOzdk3NjqCM	agent	368	61	The name is the past participle of the Genoese verb (Italian: ), which means "to pound", "to crush", in reference to the original method of preparation: according to tradition, the ingredients are "crushed" or ground in a marble mortar through a circular motion of a wooden pestle. This same Latin root, through Old French, also gave rise to the English noun "pestle".
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXAFR367JOlus4h8O6	agent	16	4	So yes, it does!
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXAOGoml_5yH-zk6Sr	user	60	12	That makes sense! Is Step five the final step in the recipe?

coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXAzdXel2FGl_1UxBl	agent	340	53	Historically, the cheeses of true Ligurian pesto were Parmigiano-Reggiano and Pecorino Sardo (or Fiore Sardo), a Sardinian sheep's-milk cheese. If you can find the Fiore Sardo, it will make a marginally better pesto sauce, but Pecorino Romano makes a darned good one, too (and, frankly, Parmigiano-Reggiano alone makes a great one as well).
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXBcq5r2ZFM592T56m	user	314	54	Thank you, that is helpful. It is much easier to find Parmigianio-Reggiano as this is most popular. Can you tell me more about the Southern recipe variations that use sun-dried peppers and tomatoes? You mentioned that they sometimes use almonds instead of pine nuts, why is that and how does this change the taste?
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXBjG6u6-Z2EJZoKDF	agent	13	3	Let me see...
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXCfeMr5VQPItnZOp_	agent	718	121	So speaking of nuts in pesto:Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy.  As a caution, though, you need to get good, fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts, or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid.Almonds could also work, although I'd think they'd be rather bland.  The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper.  Again, freshness and getting the skin off is important. As long as you toast them properly first, they are delicious (though not the same as pine nuts, of course -- not nearly as fatty, for one thing).
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXD74l0PORRIZwM79O	agent	251	41	In southern recipe variations such as "Pesto alla siciliana", sometimes called "pesto rosso" (red pesto), you have a sauce from Sicily similar to "pesto alla genovese" but with the addition of tomato, almonds instead of pine nuts, and much less basil.
coe2XtNapn	passive	-NBXDU-zaFZt0tyY5dgm	user	169	28	Hmm interesting. I never knew there was so many variations of the traditional recipe. I suppose the different ingredients were also based on what grows in those regions?

mmhHDA6eue	passive	-NBGoa6gvOs4QssieP7C	agent	240	38	So maceration is the "magic" (really science) of applied osmotic pressure. The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit.  Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking.

Instead, put the slices in the pie shell and try to make an effort to nestle the slices together as compactly as you can; it'll take a minute to pile all the apples into a mound, but they'll all fit so long as you've got a standard nine-inch glass pie plate.

mmhHDA6eue	passive	-NBGrVg3_OGFxuqVfIfZ	agent	420	70	Great question! Green apples (as used in this recipe) are especially high in pectin, which means that even though this recipe doesn't use nearly as much starch as my other pies, the filling will thicken considerably as it cools. This should be taken into consideration when putting leftovers in the fridge or freezer. However, that only means that it's best served warm—something that's been true of apple pie all along.

5c8d1bee1bb19f00019d519e	passive	-N4YWYCLD0iQTC8_erTG	agent	412	71	Thanks for your question! Whisking constantly, work the butter into the sauce, making sure to keep the sauce below the boil, lest it break. It should be silky and glossy, the butter is helping to enrich, thicken, and temper the acidic edge of the sauce even more. Sauces will usually break when there isn't enough liquid to hold the fat in suspension. Boiling removes liquid and therefore, the sauce might break.

55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71	passive	-N4Dc7YVFHwT-nhGu49n	agent	234	42	That's a really great question! You should place the chicken in a zip lock bag in order to brine it. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.
55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71	passive	-N4DcG5ta97kP0d2fLFC	user	55	12	does it matter if it sits for longer then the 24 hours?
55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71	passive	-N4DcZ8bL89GZoeRPLtF	agent	238	37	Usually, you should be brining your chicken breast anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours. However, a much, much longer brining time mitigates the effects of high-temperature frying, delivering a uniquely smooth, juicy texture to the meat.

55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71	passive	-N4De59_YwscDpFolHvd	agent	299	54	We know that shimmering oil is hotter than pooled oil (it starts shimmering at around 300 to 400°F), while smoking oil is hotter still (depending on the type of oil, this begins at around 450 to 500°F). In other words, oil is a built-in temperature indicator so simply looking at it should be enough

55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71	passive	-N4DfVTzMYP86Vb3tA0g	agent	454	84	To avoid that you should adjust the heat to maintain the temperature at 300°F for the duration of the cooking. Then fry the chicken until it’s a deep golden brown on the first side, about 6 minutes; do not move the chicken or start checking for doneness until it has fried for at least 3 minutes, or you may knock off the coating.  Then, carefully flip the chicken pieces with tongs and cook until the second side is golden brown, about 4 minutes longer.

However, if you placed the chicken in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, and up to overnight then you would have to reheat the oil to 400°F., add the chicken pieces and cook until completely crisp for about 5 minutes.

Often you can reuse it many, many times! but there's no hard and fast rule for how many time you can reuse that oil. Distrust any source that gives a firm answer on the number times you can reuse oil. It's easy to tell when you'll need to replace your oil.

55b3120cfdf99b6ef6263a71	passive	-N4DjGInUoC6-i1JU8Kr	agent	561	97	I'm not sure I have an answer to your question. However, as a general rule  the more oil breaks down, the less hydrophobic it becomes. At first, this can actually be an advantage. Less hydrophobic molecules in your oil means that it can come into closer contact with foods, allowing them to fry just a bit more efficiently. However,   as this breakdown continues, your oil becomes less and less hydrophobic, and eventually it'll start entering your food too rapidly, causing it to turn greasy and ruining its crispness. At this point you would have to change it

Curdling occurs naturally in cows' milk, if it is left open to air for a few days in a warm environment.

So if you use a ceramic mortar with a narrow ceramic pestle, the results are good, but the sauce never fully emulsifies.  The Thai granite mortar and pestle does a much better job, but it still didn't come close to the effectiveness of the Italian marble mortar with the large wooden pestle.  That large pestle head is perfect for efficiently smashing the garlic to paste, and the pine nuts, too. The basil yields under it in a fraction of the time and breaks down more fully.

If you happen to grow your own, lucky you. If you have access to a good farmers market that carries beautiful tufts of fragrant basil at the height of summer, definitely go for it. If you have to settle for supermarket clamshells of hydroponic herb, well, then, that's what it's going to be. Basically, get the best fresh basil you can, and that's all there is to it.

Once they turn from green to brown, it is all over for the pesto.To boost the 'shelf-life' of the pesto in the fridge, make sure that it is completely covered with olive oil before sealing the container.

608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	passive	-N8YIedYn4hQBnj9yQn2	agent	506	88	While it's often said that using a variety of apples can create depth of flavor, this can also introduce unnecessary variables into the equation, with some types breaking down more quickly to flood the pie with juice. When you stick with one type of apple, the pie's consistency stays the same from batch to batch; depth is created through a blend of brown sugar and spices that highlights the apples rather than overwhelming them. For this purpose, I'm a big fan of tart baking apples, like Granny Smiths.

608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	passive	-N8YJ_TQjd2GdrIjy6U4	agent	254	42	The syrup is composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. This is the result of macerating the apples.  Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking.

Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially "American", such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey.

608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	passive	-N8YMhckmuSwZ1tifsa6	agent	473	92	An egg wash is often used to make pastries shiny and golden or brown in color, and it also is used to help toppings or coatings stick to the surface of the pastry, or to bind pastry parts together, such as empanadas or other en croute recipes. Egg wash can usually be made with 30 ml or two tablespoons of liquid, such as milk or water, for every egg. Less liquid makes for a darker wash. The part of the egg used and liquid added determines the finished look of the crust.

608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	passive	-N8YNJG5LAIYs_JdGEIi	agent	470	79	An Apple crumble is a dessert of baked chopped apples topped with a crisp streusel crust. In the UK, Australia and New Zealand the term 'crumble' refers to both desserts but in the US and Canada the two are distinguished. Ingredients usually include cooked apples, butter, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and often oats and brown sugar, ginger, and/or nutmeg. One of the most common variants is "apple rhubarb crisp", in which the rhubarb provides a tart contrast to the apples.
608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	passive	-N8YNM0f7nvevmXceoz9	agent	492	85	An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is, on occasion, served with whipped cream or iced cream (which is known as "apple pie a la mode"), or with cheddar cheese. The pastry part is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a "double-crust pie"; the upper crust may be circular or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). Depending on the baker's preference, the bottom crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent it from getting soggy.

608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	passive	-N8YO-QlSgMCgAp3HyoK	agent	525	93	That's a great question! The type of pan really affects the quality of your pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy.  Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.

LFiNVaQ	passive	-NGLh3W8xsI8abJbFCq4	agent	489	77	New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially "American", such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey. "As American as apple pie" is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American.

LFiNVaQ	passive	-NGLiV_RsaDCUH6LqAD4	agent	485	83	If you are allergic to fruits from the  APPLE family (apple, pear), you can still bake an apple pie. These allergic reactions usually occur only when the food is raw. People who are allergic to the raw food can eat it cooked, canned, microwaved, processed or baked. For example, someone allergic to raw apples can eat apple sauce, apple jelly, apple juice, apple pie and dried apples. However, nuts may cause allergic reactions whether raw or cooked. This problem is usually life long.

LFiNVaQ	passive	-NGLlPXikMIucMD1W1K9	agent	608	101	The step says you need to bake until the pie reaches an internal temperature of 195°F (91°C), about 75 minutes.  This is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.

PPmiUbC	passive	-NGWxKa2_RCsqYKf7Rl-	agent	325	47	Maybe a wooden spoon might be an alternative. Cooked side-by-side, there's absolutely no detectable difference between the wooden spoon and the stand-mixer method, provided you beat extremely vigorously.  If you're even slightly lax with the hand-beating, then the stand mixer method will produce superior results every time.
PPmiUbC	passive	-NGWxWvRNvOuirIlG_nt	user	91	20	That makes sense, I've got a wooden spoon so we're ready to go! What do I have to do first?

PPmiUbC	passive	-NGWyjrDhh6MkC45ibgA	agent	578	97	In Roman times, gnocchi were made from a semolina porridge-like dough mixed with eggs, and are still found in similar forms today, particularly the oven-baked "gnocchi alla romana" and Sardinia's "malloreddus" which do not contain eggs. The name is also used in France in the dish known as "gnocchis à la parisienne", served with Béchamel sauce. A specialty of Nice, the "gnocchi de tantifla a la nissarda", is made with potatoes, wheat flour, eggs and "blette" (Swiss chard), which is also used for the "tourte de blette". "La merda dé can" is longer than the original gnocchi.
PPmiUbC	passive	-NGWz5aeroBqe5q5qF70	user	109	20	That's interesting, I didn't know there were so many versions. Is there a video showing how to mix the dough?

PPmiUbC	passive	-NGX-v9XpZLZskuTelPI	user	151	31	Ah! now I see why a balloon whisk wouldn't have worked. If I wanted to make a double quantity would it be better in two smaller batches or one big one?
PPmiUbC	passive	-NGX05Y4kQdXdoIoJTd2	agent	113	22	I'm sorry, I do not think I have this information. If I need to guess, maybe doing two batches might work better.
PPmiUbC	passive	-NGX0ShJMRUcnLt4NepN	user	134	24	Never mind, I just wondered. I think you're right though. Is this an everyday recipe or would it have been made for special occasions?
PPmiUbC	passive	-NGX0wk2jN17TkxvFVTR	agent	438	75	Actually there are special occasions to eat gnocchi: In Verona, it is tradition to eat homemade potato gnocchi on Venerdì Gnocolar, the last Friday of Carnival. In Uruguay, gnocchi are traditionally eaten on the 29th day of each month. This was the day before payday, when people were at their poorest. Gnocchi made a cheap and hearty meal. On these occasions, some people leave a coin or a banknote under the plate to attract prosperity.

xMKcudn	passive	-NGgKMbkIgz9sOro8kL8	agent	604	106	There are a number of recipes that use giblets. If a bird is to be stuffed, the giblets are traditionally chopped and added to the stuffing; however, the USDA recommends cooking giblets separately from the rest of the bird. If not, they can be used for other purposes, such as "giblet pie" or, a Southern U.S. favorite, giblet gravy. With the exception of giblet gravy, the liver is not usually included in these recipes, as its strong flavor tends to overpower other ingredients.

This can present a challenge when cooking, because we want the fat to render out and the skin to become crispy and delicious.The most common way to do this, classically, is to prick the skin all over, to permit the fat an exit path (when doing this, be careful to cut through the skin into the fat layer, but hopefully not into the meat itself)

It's particularly effective in spice rubs and breadings, where fresh garlic would be difficult to incorporate, due to its texture. So garlic granules is the better choice for our fried chicken.

KlOmIXe	passive	-NH4UhaP7Hk9AOoc-mhQ	agent	618	97	This process is called brining.  As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together.   An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.  Brines also improve juiciness by increasing the muscles' ability to retain moisture. In this case, however, a much, much longer brining time was necessary in order to completely mitigate the effects of high-temperature frying, delivering a uniquely smooth, juicy texture to the meat.

KlOmIXe	passive	-NH4Wba-fCsV28kcEQBa	agent	788	120	The first dish known to have been deep fried was fritters, which were popular in the European Middle Ages. However, it was the Scottish who were the first Europeans to deep fry their chicken in fat (though without seasoning). Meanwhile, a number of West African peoples had traditions of seasoned fried chicken (though battering and cooking the chicken in palm oil). Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Interestingly, the Roman cookbook of "Apicius" (4th century) has a recipe for deep-fried chicken called "Pullum Frontonianum".  The American English expression "fried chicken" is first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s.

The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher.

sVzhG	passive	-NJir6ZYXvL5VIQb1FmC	user	42	8	I'm not sure what pecorino fiore sardo is?
sVzhG	passive	-NJirM1DjjX7R0bqZsCn	agent	336	60	Pecorino sardo, also known as fiore sardo, is a firm cheese from the Italian island of Sardinia which is made from sheep milk: specifically from the milk of the local Sardinian breed. Its flavour is different from that of the Pecorino Romano, which is also made on the island. Sardo is richer while romano is much more biting and salty.
sVzhG	passive	-NJir_E5mHbO56lI_-7y	user	59	10	Ok interesting. What is the origins of pesto alla genovese?
sVzhG	passive	-NJis7DFF-M_LBglXT6F	agent	831	139	Pesto  or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together.  During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was "agliata", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book "La Cuciniera Genovese" in 1863
sVzhG	passive	-NJisK-Gtfk7lLNvXZ1R	user	43	9	What is the first step in making the pesto?
sVzhG	passive	-NJisOdcuKTYPkv4V2Su	agent	31	7	Let me show you the first step.
sVzhG	passive	-NJisZTgOJWqPqoXqQYH	agent	63	13	Step 1: Using a mortar and pestle, pound the garlic to a paste.
sVzhG	passive	-NJisiQ0jFowi69jhJP8	user	50	12	Can you show me a video showing me how to do this?
sVzhG	passive	-NJiswlNxiIqxCN8jXcJ	agent	56	11	Sure, you can check this video from minutes 0.57 to 1.08
sVzhG	passive	-NJitBK45zP2yMjinyzj	user	54	10	Thanks. In history who first used a pestle and mortar?
sVzhG	passive	-NJitaTetlQrCR35yKYy	agent	638	106	The adoption of ground stone technology is associated closely with the Neolithic, also called the New Stone Age. In the Levant ground stones appear in Mesolithic 2 (Natufian). In prehistoric Japan, ground stone tools appear during the Japanese Paleolithic, possibly predating adoption elsewhere in the Neolithic by 25,000 years. When mashing up seeds and leaves into powders, rounded and smooth ground stones would be used inside a stone bowl. This pair of tools is called a mortar and pestle. The material would be placed into the mortar and the pestle would be moved and pressed into the mortar to grind the material into a fine powder.
sVzhG	passive	-NJitpcOrKtgFXKcPNjj	user	52	10	Interesting. So what is the next step in the recipe?
sVzhG	passive	-NJitszbR8xyFukPTZhM	agent	142	24	Step 2:  Add pine nuts and continue to crush with pestle, smashing and grinding them, until a sticky, only slightly chunky, beige paste forms.

sVzhG	passive	-NJiu0wh7UqFoB_8D5Am	agent	223	43	Step 3:  Add basil leaves, a handful at a time, and pound and grind against the walls of the mortar. Add pinch of salt with each handful to act as an abrasive. Continue until all basil leaves have been crushed to fine bits.
sVzhG	passive	-NJiu9iBftCZGMtS6TS8	user	24	6	And what do you do next?
sVzhG	passive	-NJiuDMdjh-7hWx6_xYu	agent	184	32	Step 4:  Add both cheeses, then slowly drizzle in olive oil, working it into the pesto with the pestle until a fairly smooth, creamy, emulsified, sauce forms. Add more oil, if desired.
sVzhG	passive	-NJiuUWdnJ-2jm1gJcfc	user	108	25	Do you use pestle and mortar for this step or do you just mix it in? Can you show me a video for this stage?
sVzhG	passive	-NJiunkI0CrdpUu8YUPt	agent	56	11	Yes! You should be using pestle and mortar in this step.

After doing so you can proceed by  adding mustard and cheese and beat with wooden spoon until homogenous. You can then  add eggs one at a time, beating vigorously with each addition to prevent eggs from curdling and allowing dough to fully incorporate egg before adding the next one.  When final egg has been added, add herbs and beat to combine.

2b71cb60	passive	-NKcdqysw-DoDAY_NTSM	agent	295	52	That is a great question! I would not recommend using chilli olive oil.  More precisely, as long as you're using a decent, somewhat mild olive oil, your pesto is going to be good; if you feel like using an even higher-quality, not-too-spicy oil, whether Ligurian or not, it may be subtly better.
2b71cb60	passive	-NKce02Gt07Jw25Q8Jqz	user	98	22	ok i have regular olive oil so will use that. i might put some walnuts in as well as the pine nuts
2b71cb60	passive	-NKceBY9qX2ViqClz_Wn	agent	103	19	Yes, that would work.  Most recipes for pesto sauce call for pine nuts, but walnuts are not unheard of.
2b71cb60	passive	-NKceGo1qa2sy6-atGU2	agent	37	7	Also,  toasting nuts is not worth it.

68942e2a	passive	-NKcsgDXckgCcstsh8Lb	user	128	22	I have all the ingredients but I would like to know the difference between southern fried chicken and just normal fried chicken.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcsnlgtD7EYRFLssCz	agent	32	8	Sure! Let me see what I can find
68942e2a	passive	-NKct7NXR6foGQtd7pXx	agent	356	60	There is no difference. Southern fried chicken, also known as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces which have been coated in a seasoned batter and pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat. Broiler chickens are most commonly used.
68942e2a	passive	-NKctPlGqAijVW908ygp	user	105	22	Can you also tell me why it takes so long to cook? Is it because we have to cook each piece individually?
68942e2a	passive	-NKctuYLitAgW0MxBk6U	user	153	34	So what is my first step? I assume it is to brine the chicken. I don't see any water in the recipe to mix the Kosher salt with. How much water do I need?
68942e2a	passive	-NKctysmgMHTYAMgNBA2	agent	105	24	Yes. It takes a bit of time as you'll have to first fry the chicken one piece at a time and then bake it.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcu0DBmpgRzWX2t2Lm	agent	31	7	Let me show you the first step.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcuA8IhGDAQAvYSs0f	user	61	11	No problem. I have everything in the dish and mixed together.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcuGWAX6o5QYHmrs6Y	agent	22	5	That is great to hear!
68942e2a	passive	-NKcuJqsum4q4i7R7NbI	user	40	8	So I assume the chick is already brined?
68942e2a	passive	-NKcuQUCUYjm7Y6Wmadm	agent	45	11	That's part of step 2. Let me show it to you.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcufsd8Ke1uCbL9jKo	user	72	17	Why would this not be step one since it has to sit for at least 4 hours?
68942e2a	passive	-NKcv-8Q1RPSejhuWuZY	agent	90	17	That's because in step 1 you are required to prepare the spice mixture required in step 2.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcv4FvibgBQ4_1wlSS	agent	129	23	More precisely, you need to whisk the buttermilk, egg, 1 tablespoon salt, and 2 tablespoons of the spice mixture in a large bowl.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcvFxYSJ28lPrdaZtm	user	77	17	Ah I see.  I guess I'm not used to brining the chicken with the spices on it.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcvb0JzmMHaAy-OKQT	agent	113	23	As a reminder, if you'd like to go to the next step simply type "next". To go to a previous step type "previous".
68942e2a	passive	-NKcveIdTyAqbZxUGVrp	user	55	10	So  that should really get the spices into the chicken.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcvg00SNM2RPz9Lq1w	user	4	1	next
68942e2a	passive	-NKcvoQAU7HDj-_ABMXS	agent	229	35	Exactly,  An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.  Brines also improve juiciness by increasing the muscles' ability to retain moisture.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcvrEsSF-JvKf8X4cM	agent	87	15	However, my normal brining for chicken breast is anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours.

68942e2a	passive	-NKcxJIwEI6ODLWifwy7	agent	35	8	Ok great! Let's go to the next step
68942e2a	passive	-NKcxMV1KZPMnOY5REeL	user	70	13	Actually, what this the best way to check the doneness of the chicken?
68942e2a	passive	-NKcxVhtI64c-J2E3m1p	agent	51	11	That's a great question! Let me see what I can find
68942e2a	passive	-NKcxu2KAWu-sj2pD8B9	agent	155	32	So the best way to ensure your chicken is fully cooked is to fry it until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace.
68942e2a	passive	-NKcxvM6OZcYxrTTgkQs	agent	177	29	The result is chicken with a deep brown, craggy crust that's shatteringly crisp but not tough and that breaks away to meat that bursts with intensely seasoned juices underneath.

68942e2a	passive	-NKd-0yIQHvl6hSbahg_	agent	87	18	That's great to hear. Let me see if I can find how to make buttermilk from normal milk.

68942e2a	passive	-NKd-K-vfUQ-7sbxwk7I	agent	319	60	So, "Acidified buttermilk" is a substitute for buttermilk made by adding a food-grade acid such as vinegar or lemon juice to milk. It can be produced by mixing 1 tablespoon of acid with 1 cup of milk and letting it sit until it curdles for about 10 minutes. Any level of fat content for the milk ingredient may be used.

7460a2a0	passive	-NKgrKqsebCjqiYToOP1	agent	165	30	It's perfect for this recipe as you want a good melter with low water content.  That means a semifirm cheese that can be grated into shreds, like Gruyère or cheddar.

7460a2a0	passive	-NKgsSHpYEKbPNNLNa86	user	61	12	ok, can you please tell me the history of the souffle recipe?
7460a2a0	passive	-NKgsoDyt8x7a_uGmT_n	agent	634	104	A soufflé is a baked egg-based dish which originated in early eighteenth century France. It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb "souffler" which means "to blow", "to breathe", "to inflate" or "to puff". The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century.

7460a2a0	passive	-NKgvqbKOL4dDhnG2Ped	agent	959	177	I have to say, there's no single best way to separate an egg. First, though, a few tips: Make sure your hands are scrupulously clean. No matter how you separate your eggs, the yolks and whites are likely to come into contact with your fingers. You don't want to transfer anything germy from your hands to the eggs. No matter what method you use, start by gently cracking the egg against a flat surface, so that you don't get eggshell into the egg. Cold eggs are easier to separate than those at room temperature; the yolk breaks less easily.  Fresh eggs are easier to separate than older ones. After cracking the egg, gently pry the shell halves apart. Let the yolk settle into the bottom half of the shell, allowing the white to run over the shell and into a measuring cup or small bowl. Some white will remain with the yolk, so you can gently transfer the yolk back and forth between the shell, continuing to let the white drip over the shell into the bowl.

7460a2a0	passive	-NKh-0uOYol8qRY1tgPQ	agent	317	62	That is a great question!  That gentle folding is key since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them.
