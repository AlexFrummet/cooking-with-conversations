If you replace water with buttermilk, not only does the chicken come out just as moist as with water brine, it is actually significantly more tender as well, due to the tenderizing effects of buttermilk on food (soaking it for more than one night led to chicken that was so tender that it bordered on mush).

o9UbVjHVrS	active	female	25-34	-NBMF8vcfIrDLphxKlMD	-NBMF-3BYv92LYWGXTzN	knowledge	ingredient	what is buttermilk?	Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. However, most modern buttermilk is cultured. It is common in warm climates (including the Balkans, South Asia, the Middle East and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly. Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making Soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, which the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat.			7	7	7	0	0	2	0	0.0

o9UbVjHVrS	active	female	25-34	-NBMGX5eVgptJN3zbwON	-NBMGMQOrrMflJFg1FA6			more please	Buttermilk is the byproduct of butter making.Butter is made by agitating cream resulting in clumps of fat and a milky white liquid that contains nearly no fat and some protein. If the cream was soured before (either by aging or by inoculating the cream with lactobacillae), the buttermilk will also be sour. If the butter was made from unfermented cream, the buttermilk will be mild.Uncultured buttermilk is rarely sold, even if butter is made commercially with regular cream, the resulting buttermilk is soured afterwards.As buttermilk is made from a fraction of whole milk (the cream), you could say it’s a part of soured milk. I outlined the process of butter making in this answer, that should also help understanding buttermilk.			7	8	8	0	0	0	0	1.0

So a soufflé is a fundamentally simple thing that leverages the power of eggs to achieve impressive results.  All classic soufflés, sweet and savory, start with a base that provides richness and structure.  In savory soufflés, like the cheese soufflé I'm demonstrating here, the base is a thick béchamel sauce, usually calling for about three tablespoons flour per cup of milk.			3	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

You can either use an expensive copper egg-beating bowl, which helps form more stable beaten whites that are less prone to breaking and weeping (the copper interferes with too-strong sulfur bonds from forming). You can add a little cream of tartar to the whites, an acid that also prevents those sulfur bonds from forming.			0	2	2	1	0	0	0	0.0

That gentle folding is key, since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them. That's what causes a soufflé to rise, and really, there's no stopping it—your beaten whites will contain air bubbles and those air bubbles will expand, and when they do your soufflé will push higher and higher in its baking dish.			3	4	4	2	0	0	0	0.0

Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough. Adding butter and other fats to the dough will further diminish its gluten-forming abilities. If we were to try and make gnocchi with a cold water dough, one with plenty of springy, elastic gluten, we'd have a heck of a time getting those gnocchi hot enough to expand to the point where they come out nice and airy; Instead, we'd end up with dense, chewy nubs that taste more like damp bread.			2	3	Three.	2	0	0	0	0.0

Pans of a single design from a single vendor will usually share the same rim height and rake across all tray sizes in a series, thus the sacrifice of flat baking surface is proportionally greater (relative to outer dimension) for small pans than for large pans.			3	3	There are three facts in this text.	0	0	2	0	0.0

About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines, the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of notable value as a human food. Throughout Europe and Middle East the pine nuts used are traditionally from ""Pinus pinea"" (stone pine). They are easily distinguished from the Asian pine nuts by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian pine nuts are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations. Pine nuts contain thiamine (vitamin B) and protein."			7	6	6	0	0	2	0	0.0

They are seeds found inside the structure of the pine cone. Technically, sunflower seeds would provide the most similar flavor when looking for a pine nut substitution in traditional recipes. Sesame seeds would also offer a solution to those with nut allergies that don't have pine nuts on hand.			3	3	3	0	0	0	0	1.0

It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the temperate zone, and others in subtropical climates. Although basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.			3	8	There are eight facts in this text.	0	0	2	0	0.0

Pour apple filling into the prepared pie shell, nestling the slices into a flattish mound. Stand top crust a few seconds at room temperature until pliable, then drape on top. Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch. Tuck the dough under itself, so the pie looks something like a bonnet, or crimp into loose waves (the crust will not hold a tightly crimped design). Refrigerate the pie until cold and firm, at least 30 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (200°C).			0	6	6	0	1	0	0	0.0

"Good question:  The liquid you see after macerating the apples is a syrup composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. ( The mixture weighs little more than the brown sugar added in step one.) This is more or less the same thing that happens with my fresh lemon syrup, in which dry lemon rinds are tossed with seven ounces of sugar to yield a scant eight ounces of syrup after a few hours. That lack of moisture means there's no need to spend time and energy cooking the liquid down to concentrate the ""juices,"" as the liquid is already quite concentrated in terms of both flavor and water content. Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose, while the overall water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch."			2	3	3	2	0	0	0	0.0

I may be wrong, but the answer probably has something to do with how well it holds heat	So your guess regarding the heat is correct! That's the important thing. In our case, glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie. Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.			0	3	There are three facts in this text: 1. Glass conducts heat at a moderate pace, resulting in flaky and crispy crust.                                 2. Heavy materials like thick ceramic or stoneware will slow down the heat conduction process, producing a greasy crust                                 3. Lightweight metals like aluminum may speed up the heat conduction process too much, resulting in a partially cooked filling.	1	0	0	0	0.0

It is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.			3	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

Beef or veal stock is ideal, since those bones give up enough gelatin to make a truly spectacular sauce. If you don't want to do that, a brown chicken stock is your next best choice; it won't have quite as much gelatin as a good beef or veal stock, so the sauce won't get quite the same body, but it'll still be great.			1	2	2	2	0	0	0	0.0

To do it, you add water to the sugar first, which wets and dissolves it, speeding up the caramelization process while helping to prevent scorching. The water cooks off as the mixture boils (which, incidentally, you can swirl and stir and otherwise monkey with to ensure even browning, no wet pastry brush needed), and it's clear to the eye when the caramel reaches a nice deep amber color. At this point, you can add the vinegar in very small additions, gently swirling as you do; it will boil and bubble violently, so take your time to avoid a boil-over. Some of the sugar might seize up a bit, but if you keep swirling, it'll dissolve back into the solution quickly.			3	3	There are 3 facts in this text: 1) Adding water to sugar speeds up the caramelization process and prevents scorching     2) The water cooks off as the mixture boils and the caramel turns amber in color     3) Vinegar can be added in small additions, causing boiling and bubbling, and some sugar may seize up but will dissolve back into the solution if stirred.	2	0	0	0	0.0

If you've ever carved a roast chicken or turkey before, then you've got nothing to worry about, because cutting the meat off a duck crown is the same as carving the breasts of any roast bird. And even if you haven't done much carving in your life, don't sweat it; it's easy. The most important thing you need to do in terms of carving happens before the duck even goes in the oven—removing the wishbone. As I mentioned in the primer for dry-aging ducks, I like to remove the wishbone after the birds have finished aging in the fridge. The skin and flesh around the neck cavity dry out during the aging process, making it easier to locate and cut out the wishbone cleanly, without taking a chunk of breast meat with it. Once the crown is roasted and rested, carving the breasts off the cage is pretty simple. Use a sharp knife, preferably a slicer with a long thin blade that allows you to cut with smooth even strokes. Slice into the breast on one side of the breastbone and use steady, smooth knife strokes, riding the contour of the breastbone with the blade and gently pulling the breast back with your off-hand as you cut. The breast will gradually pull away from the cage, and you can cut it away completely at the point where it connects with the shoulder joint. Remove the second breast and then set aside the crown carcass for making another batch of duck stock. Take a second to trim up the breasts before slicing and serving. The bottom edge of the breast where it protruded from the crown has very little meat along with some tough cartilage and skin. Place the breasts skin-side-down on your board, trim off those pieces, and discard them. On the upper edge of the breast, you will find a large pocket of fat between the meat and skin. I like to trim that away as well. Now you get to pick your preferred slicing presentation for serving. You can slice the breasts crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces that are ideal for a family-style meal or in half, lengthwise, if you're going for more of a minimalist fine-dining vibe.			7	14	14	0	0	0	5	0.0

Yes precisely. The coating overcooks long before the chicken is cooked through to the center. Hence, just fry the chicken until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace. The result is chicken with a deep brown, craggy crust that's shatteringly crisp but not tough and that breaks away to meat that bursts with intensely seasoned juices underneath.			0	3	Three.	1	0	0	0	0.0

Peanut and canola are vegetable oils. Oils labelled vegetable oil are blends and can be any proportion of things like canola (rapeseed), peanut, corn, sunflower, etc. Different vegetable oils will give different properties although most will give you about the same result. Canola is flavorless and relatively light while peanut is a bit richer and, well, peanut-y. The differences will be subtle.			3	3	3	0	0	0	0	1.0

This might help you! Remove the wings. Stand the chicken on its neck, legs point to the ceiling and breasts pointing away from you. slide the cleaver between the body and wing, cutting through the joint close to the body.  You should slide the knife between the joint cutting only the tendons, not the bone.Remove the legs.  lie the chicken on its back one leg near you, one leg away from you.  slide the knife between the joint near the body, again cutting only tendon not bone and remove the leg.Separate the thigh from the drumstick, again go for the joint.  If you want the legs to be in smaller pieces then you can cut each thigh and drumstick in two with a firm action.  You have 2 choices for techniqueStart with the cleaver tip furthest from you on the board, place the thigh under the blade and push down firmly and quickly.  you should cut through the bone.Chop through the bone by lifting the cleaver in the air and bringing down hard and fast.  This has better chance of a cleaner cut through the bone, but you need to be a better aim. Split the carcass in half.  Stand in the same position as 1. and with the blade parallel to to your body cut down through the carcass so you have the back and the breast in separate piecesRemove the breast from the bone by sliding the knife (might want to use a smaller knife here) between the meat and the bone.  Remove the backbone out of the back, kitchen scissors are easiest.  you can skip this if the back doesn't have much meat.Cut the back pieces into nice size pieces across the length.Slice the breast pieces crosswise into nice size piecesReassemble the chicken on the plate with the breast meat on top of the back pieces			7	7	7	0	0	0	0	1.0

You really are an expert!Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution. As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together).			1	1	1	1	0	0	0	0.0

Yes precisely!  The problem here is gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water which could cause the crust to become really hard and with rock-like density.

If you happen to grow your own, lucky you. If you have access to a good farmers market that carries beautiful tufts of fragrant basil at the height of summer, definitely go for it. If you have to settle for supermarket clamshells of hydroponic herb, well, then, that's what it's going to be.

"Pesto or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together. The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the ""Appendix Vergiliana"", an ancient collection of poems where the author dwells on the details about the preparation of ""moretum"". During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was ""agliata"", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book ""La Cuciniera Genovese"" in 1863:"			2	5	There are 5 facts in this text.	0	0	3	0	0.0

"An emulsion is a mixture of two or more liquids that are normally immiscible (unmixable or unblendable). Emulsions are part of a more general class of two-phase systems of matter called colloids. Although the terms ""colloid"" and ""emulsion"" are sometimes used interchangeably, ""emulsion"" should be used when both phases, dispersed and continuous, are liquids. In an emulsion, one liquid (the dispersed phase) is dispersed in the other (the continuous phase). Examples of emulsions include vinaigrettes, homogenized milk, and some cutting fluids for metal working."			7	6	6	0	0	1	0	0.0

A glass pie plate is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.			3	3	There are 3 facts in this text.	1	0	0	0	0.0

And could I substitute another salt if we're having trouble finding this? If so, would it impact any of the other ingredients in any way?	That's a great question! And yes there is a reason for using it! Kosher salt or kitchen salt is coarse edible salt without common additives such as iodine. Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents. Because the salt has a purer flavor due to the lack of metallic or bitter-tasting additives such as iodine, fluoride or dextrose, it is often used in the kitchen instead of additive-containing table salt, so such flavors are not introduced to prepared food.			3	4	4	0	0	2	0	0.0

Brining is the process by which a lean meat (most often chicken, turkey, or pork) is submerged in a saltwater solution. As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together).			1	2	2	1	0	0	0	0.0

Wow, seems that you're already an expert :-) You're right:  First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases.  Breading will help mitigate this effect to a degree by slowing down the transfer of energy to the meat, but a significant amount of squeezing is still going to occur regardless of how well breaded the chicken is. Myosin is one of the key proteins responsible for this squeezing action, so by dissolving it, you prevent a lot of moisture loss from taking place.			2	2	2	1	0	0	0	0.0
ABFwuoU	active	female	45-54	-NH9xnQGvYLqleE9K8Nv	-NH9xSQL7h8ZJ5Zb1VOg			It adds extra moisture,flavour and helps in keeping the meat tender while cooking.	Second, brining alters the texture of the meat by allowing dissolved proteins to cross-link with each other. This is the main principle behind sausage making—dissolved proteins can bond with each other, creating a pleasantly bouncy, tender texture. Third, as the brine slowly works its way into the meat, it seasons it beyond just the very surface. An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.			3	3	There are three facts in this text.	1	0	0	0	0.0

By doing this, the chicken comes out just as moist as with water brine, and it is significantly more tender as well, due to the tenderizing effects of buttermilk on food (soaking it for more than one night led to chicken that was so tender that it bordered on mush).  Finally, hitting the buttermilk with spices helps build flavor right into the surface of the bird.			3	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

What happens quite often here is that your crust is almost rock-like in its density.  Knowing that gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water—is the most likely culprit, you can minimize its formation.  First and foremost: cut the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein.  Replacing a quarter of the flour worked well. Adding a couple teaspoons of baking powder to the mix helped bring a bit of air to the mix, forming a crust that was lighter and crisper, with increased surface area (and we all know that more surface area = more crispness, right?).			3	6	6	1	0	0	0	0.0

One last problem you often run into is the coating overcooking long before the chicken is cooked through to the center. This can be solved quite easily:  Just fry the chicken until golden brown, then transfer it to a hot oven to finish cooking at a gentler pace.  The result is chicken with a deep brown, craggy crust that's shatteringly crisp but not tough and that breaks away to meat that bursts with intensely seasoned juices underneath.			0	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

So breast meat is composed mainly of what are known as fast-twitch muscles—muscles that are rarely used on a day-to-day basis, but are great for quick, powerful bursts of action. Fast-twitch muscle tends to be relatively light in color and low in connective tissue and fat. Leg meat, on the other hand, is mainly slow-twitch muscle. It's used day in and day out as the turkey walks around scratching for food. As a result, it's darker and packed with tough connective tissue. Because the two muscle structures are so massively different, they must be cooked differently to achieve ideal results. Breast meat is best when cooked to no higher than about 150°F-any higher and it dries out. On the other hand, the tough connective tissue in leg meat doesn't get tender until it gets to at least 165°F (74°C) or so.			3	6	6	0	0	0	2	0.0

Those smallest ones measure a mere six and a half by nine and a half inches. For whatever reason, these smaller sheet pans rarely make their way into home kitchens. It's bizarre, because, as handy as they are in commercial kitchens, they're even more useful at home, where we routinely cook smaller portions of food.			3	5	Five facts. 1.

Most fruit pie fillings are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie.  When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.			0	3	Three.	1	0	0	0	0.0

Hot apple pie fresh out of the oven might sound appealing, but letting it rest for a couple of hours will give you better results in the end. For one thing, most recipes are designed for optimum texture at room temperature. Slice that pie while it's too hot, and it'll be runny and wet instead of perfectly glazed and juicy. Pie crust also fares better at room temperature, where it'll have a flakier, crisper texture.			2	3	3	0	0	0	1	0.0

This comparison will vary, depending on factors including, for example, how much food is being cooked at once or if airflow is being restricted, for example by an oversized baking tray. This difference in cooking temperature is offset as the circulating air transfers heat more quickly than still air of the same temperature.

With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it. There are two kinked proteins in flour, glutenin, and gliadin. Get them lubricated and rub them around enough through mechanical action (like kneading), and they tend to stretch out and bind with each other, forming the stretchy protein matrix known as gluten.			3	3	3	2	0	0	0	0.0

By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.			0	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

"So New England was the first region to experience large-scale English colonization in the early 17th century, beginning in 1620, and it was dominated by East Anglian Calvinists, better known as the Puritans. Baking was a particular favorite of the New Englanders and was the origin of dishes seen today as quintessentially ""American"", such as apple pie and the oven-roasted Thanksgiving turkey. ""As American as apple pie"" is a well-known phrase used to suggest that something is all-American."			3	3	3	0	0	1	0	0.0

"Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking. Maceration is the ""magic"" (really science) of applied osmotic pressure. The sugar mixture will draw fluid out of the fruit (indeed, many maceration steps are done by mixing the dry sugar with the fruit, rather than by placing the fruit in sugar-water - there is soon fluid, and the osmotic pressure is considerably higher since the concentration of sugar is higher.

Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose, while the overall water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch. Once the apples have collapsed by a third, you can add the tapioca starch, then seal the whole thing back up to toss around until it's well combined. Waiting to add the tapioca starch prevents it from interfering with maceration.			0	3	Three.	2	0	0	0	0.0

Adding the starch pulls the liquid out of the apples, concentrates the flavor in extracted juice, and then preserves the shape of the fruit during baking. It also reduces the chance of your pie boiling over during baking, and prevents empty space inside the pie under the crust. So yes, it prevents deteriorating a bit.			3	6	There are 6 facts in this text.	0	0	0	0	1.0

cegcgsG	active	female	55-64	-NGusXPorNbKoO2IAC6F	-NGusS_ZcmdFgNnFeejH	knowledge	equipment	why couldn't I use a pie tin?	Glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.			3	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

Another interesting fact:  Green apples are especially high in pectin, which means that even though this recipe doesn't use nearly as much starch as my other pies, the filling will thicken considerably as it cools. That only means that it's best served warm—something that's been true of apple pie all along.			1	1	1	2	0	0	0	0.0

You have some room to play with a soufflé, a little more or less flour in your béchamel, maybe, or slightly different oven settings, but stray too far and you've left camp soufflé and veered into other territory. Add too much more flour, for example, and your soufflé is going to start to resemble a cake; too little and it'll be too thin to hold its shape, spilling up and over the sides of its container. In this recipe the amount of flour in the béchamel is leaning toward the high end of what's generally called for. It makes a soufflé that rises just a little less dramatically, but it still rises plenty.			2	6	6	2	0	0	0	0.0

When beating egg whites, they are classified in three stages according to the peaks they form when the beater is lifted: soft, firm, and stiff peaks.

tLrorpH	active	female	55-64	-NGvkDqydiPas4r4debA	-NGvk-ZPZtWlyb2nlBdR	preparation		what is the second addition?	In the second addition gentle folding is key, since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them. That's what causes a soufflé to rise, and really, there's no stopping it—your beaten whites will contain air bubbles and those air bubbles will expand, and when they do your soufflé will push higher and higher in its baking dish.			3	3	3	2	0	0	0	0.0

"First, the heat of the oven is a critical ""ingredient"" for getting a soufflé to rise; it's what causes gases to expand inside all those trapped air bubbles and what converts moisture in the soufflé batter to steam. Together, those forces expand the air bubbles and cause the soufflé to swell. The hotter the oven, the more quickly and fully the soufflé will rise, and the faster it will brown and set on the outside. The heat also sets the proteins in the egg yolks and whites, allowing the soufflé to keep some of its height even after cooling. Without the eggs setting, the soufflé batter would remain liquid and would immediately collapse back down to its original state as soon as it cooled. Lastly, the heat browns the surface of the soufflé, giving it a deeper flavor, thanks to our good friend the Maillard reaction."			7	4	There are 4 facts in the text.	4	0	0	0	0.0

This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the amine group of a free amino acid and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar, usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry, since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor.			3	6	6	0	0	1	0	0.0

A 400°F oven produced a marginally taller soufflé than a 375°F oven did.  But the soufflé is also more likely to remain runny in the center, since it'd come close to burning on the outside if you were to leave it long enough to cook through to the center.  If you use a lower oven temperature, like 350°F or 375°F, you'll get slightly less of a rise, and the soufflé will brown on the outside more slowly.  That buys you time to leave the soufflé in the oven longer, letting it cook through more fully to the center with less risk that the surface blackens in the process.			2	4	There are four facts in this text.	4	0	0	0	0.0

Savory soufflés often include cheese, and vegetables such as spinach, carrot and herbs, and may sometimes incorporate poultry, bacon, ham, or seafood for a more substantial dish. Sweet soufflés may be based on a chocolate or fruit sauce (lemon or raspberry, for example), and are often served with a dusting of powdered sugar.

With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it.  A ball of well-kneaded cold water dough will spring back if you press it and contract if you stretch it. This is why, for example, pizza dough is extremely hard to roll out until it's had at least a couple hours to rest and allow this gluten to relax.			3	3	3	2	0	0	0	0.0
c70f521	active	female	45-54	-NKdD1vMRvPhk8fQNOcg	-NKdCYacLvvT9TYWw0LT			No idea	A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.			0	3	There are three facts in the text.	1	0	0	0	0.0

First, the meat all over is on the darker side, giving it a richer, oilier texture that can better withstand the drying effects of high temperatures.

In confectionery and candy making, cream of tartar is commonly used as the acidulant, with typical amounts in the range of 0.15-0.25% of the sugar's weight. The use of cream of tartar imparts a honey-like flavor to the syrup. After the inversion is completed, it may be neutralized with baking soda using a weight of 45% of the cream of tartar's weight.			1	3	3	0	0	1	0	0.0

The beauty of a hot water dough is that it doesn't bounce back as much as a cold water dough does.  As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple, kind of like Play-Do. With our tender, easy-to-shape hot water dough, however, the stretching is easy, and, what's more, the gnocchi keep their stretched-out shape even after they begin to cool, ensuring that they stay light and tender no matter how we choose to finish them off.			3	3	Three.	4	0	0	0	0.0

Can you tell me more about the Southern recipe variations that use sun-dried peppers and tomatoes? You mentioned that they sometimes use almonds instead of pine nuts, why is that and how does this change the taste?	So speaking of nuts in pesto:Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy.  As a caution, though, you need to get good, fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts, or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid.Almonds could also work, although I'd think they'd be rather bland.  The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper.  Again, freshness and getting the skin off is important. As long as you toast them properly first, they are delicious (though not the same as pine nuts, of course -- not nearly as fatty, for one thing).			2	6	6	0	0	0	0	2.0

Does allowing it to boil ruin the mixture of ingredients somehow?	Thanks for your question! Whisking constantly, work the butter into the sauce, making sure to keep the sauce below the boil, lest it break. It should be silky and glossy, the butter is helping to enrich, thicken, and temper the acidic edge of the sauce even more. Sauces will usually break when there isn't enough liquid to hold the fat in suspension. Boiling removes liquid and therefore, the sauce might break.			3	3	There are three facts in this text: 1.

You should place the chicken in a zip lock bag in order to brine it.

Usually, you should be brining your chicken breast anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours.

However, as a general rule  the more oil breaks down, the less hydrophobic it becomes. At first, this can actually be an advantage. Less hydrophobic molecules in your oil means that it can come into closer contact with foods, allowing them to fry just a bit more efficiently. However,   as this breakdown continues, your oil becomes less and less hydrophobic, and eventually it'll start entering your food too rapidly, causing it to turn greasy and ruining its crispness.

That's a really good question. So does It Matter What Kind of Mortar and Pestle You Use for Pesto? So if you use a ceramic mortar with a narrow ceramic pestle, the results are good, but the sauce never fully emulsifies.  The Thai granite mortar and pestle does a much better job, but it still didn't come close to the effectiveness of the Italian marble mortar with the large wooden pestle.  That large pestle head is perfect for efficiently smashing the garlic to paste, and the pine nuts, too. The basil yields under it in a fraction of the time and breaks down more fully.			3	6	6	2	0	0	0	0.0

Unless you're reading this from Liguria itself, you probably don't have access to the prized basil of that region. If you happen to grow your own, lucky you. If you have access to a good farmers market that carries beautiful tufts of fragrant basil at the height of summer, definitely go for it. If you have to settle for supermarket clamshells of hydroponic herb, well, then, that's what it's going to be. Basically, get the best fresh basil you can, and that's all there is to it.			1	3	3	2	0	0	0	0.0

While it's often said that using a variety of apples can create depth of flavor, this can also introduce unnecessary variables into the equation, with some types breaking down more quickly to flood the pie with juice. When you stick with one type of apple, the pie's consistency stays the same from batch to batch; depth is created through a blend of brown sugar and spices that highlights the apples rather than overwhelming them. For this purpose, I'm a big fan of tart baking apples, like Granny Smiths.			1	4	4	2	0	0	0	0.0

The syrup is composed primarily of brown sugar dissolved by a small amount of tart apple juice. This is the result of macerating the apples.  Macerating helps break down the fruit's structure, leading to a massive reduction in volume without any cooking.			3	2	There are two facts in this text.	2	0	0	0	0.0

An egg wash is often used to make pastries shiny and golden or brown in color, and it also is used to help toppings or coatings stick to the surface of the pastry, or to bind pastry parts together, such as empanadas or other en croute recipes. Egg wash can usually be made with 30 ml or two tablespoons of liquid, such as milk or water, for every egg. Less liquid makes for a darker wash. The part of the egg used and liquid added determines the finished look of the crust.			3	3	There are three facts in this text.	0	0	1	0	0.0

"An Apple crumble is a dessert of baked chopped apples topped with a crisp streusel crust. In the UK, Australia and New Zealand the term 'crumble' refers to both desserts but in the US and Canada the two are distinguished. Ingredients usually include cooked apples, butter, sugar, flour, cinnamon, and often oats and brown sugar, ginger, and/or nutmeg. One of the most common variants is ""apple rhubarb crisp"", in which the rhubarb provides a tart contrast to the apples."			5	5	There are 5 facts in this text.	0	0	3	0	0.0

"An apple pie is a pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apple. It is, on occasion, served with whipped cream or iced cream (which is known as ""apple pie a la mode""), or with cheddar cheese. The pastry part is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a ""double-crust pie""; the upper crust may be circular or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). Depending on the baker's preference, the bottom crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent it from getting soggy."			3	4	4	0	0	0	0	0.0

The type of pan really affects the quality of your pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy.  Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.			2	3	3	1	0	0	0	0.0

For example, someone allergic to raw apples can eat apple sauce, apple jelly, apple juice, apple pie and dried apples. However, nuts may cause allergic reactions whether raw or cooked.

This is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.			3	4	There are four facts in this text.	1	0	0	0	0.0

In Uruguay, gnocchi are traditionally eaten on the 29th day of each month. This was the day before payday, when people were at their poorest. Gnocchi made a cheap and hearty meal.

With the exception of giblet gravy, the liver is not usually included in these recipes, as its strong flavor tends to overpower other ingredients.

EioCaKa	passive	male	18-24	-NGzuTa4Je1tvU2IBtbO	-NGzu-_WzJn8QoBmrlTy	knowledge	step_importance	why does the duck skin need to be pricked?	Duck is high in fat, so when roasting a whole duck you can end up with a lot of fat left with the duck inside the skin and soggier skin. This can present a challenge when cooking, because we want the fat to render out and the skin to become crispy and delicious.The most common way to do this, classically, is to prick the skin all over, to permit the fat an exit path (when doing this, be careful to cut through the skin into the fat layer, but hopefully not into the meat itself)			3	3	3	0	0	0	0	2.0

KlOmIXe	passive	male	45-54	-NH4UhaP7Hk9AOoc-mhQ	-NH4Tyu5lh8dnetOLQKR	ingredient		will the taste be very different if I reduce marinating time?	This process is called brining.  As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together.   An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.  Brines also improve juiciness by increasing the muscles' ability to retain moisture. In this case, however, a much, much longer brining time was necessary in order to completely mitigate the effects of high-temperature frying, delivering a uniquely smooth, juicy texture to the meat.			3	4	4	2	0	0	0	0.0

Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Interestingly, the Roman cookbook of ""Apicius"" (4th century) has a recipe for deep-fried chicken called ""Pullum Frontonianum"".  The American English expression ""fried chicken"" is first recorded in the 1830s, and frequently appears in American cookbooks of the 1860s and 1870s."			7	6	6	0	0	3	0	0.0

"Pesto  or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together.  During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was ""agliata"", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book ""La Cuciniera Genovese"" in 1863"			3	5	5	0	0	3	0	0.0

The adoption of ground stone technology is associated closely with the Neolithic, also called the New Stone Age. In the Levant ground stones appear in Mesolithic 2 (Natufian). In prehistoric Japan, ground stone tools appear during the Japanese Paleolithic, possibly predating adoption elsewhere in the Neolithic by 25,000 years. When mashing up seeds and leaves into powders, rounded and smooth ground stones would be used inside a stone bowl. This pair of tools is called a mortar and pestle. The material would be placed into the mortar and the pestle would be moved and pressed into the mortar to grind the material into a fine powder.			7	5	5	0	0	2	0	0.0

"A soufflé is a baked egg-based dish which originated in early eighteenth century France. It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb ""souffler"" which means ""to blow"", ""to breathe"", ""to inflate"" or ""to puff"". The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century. The development and popularization of the soufflé is usually traced to French chef Marie-Antoine Carême in the early nineteenth century."			7	5	5	0	0	3	0	0.0

7460a2a0	passive	male	45-54	-NKgvqbKOL4dDhnG2Ped	-NKgvI764M10d-2sdVk6	cooking_technique		What is the best method to separate egg yolk from the white?	I have to say, there's no single best way to separate an egg. First, though, a few tips: Make sure your hands are scrupulously clean. No matter how you separate your eggs, the yolks and whites are likely to come into contact with your fingers. You don't want to transfer anything germy from your hands to the eggs. No matter what method you use, start by gently cracking the egg against a flat surface, so that you don't get eggshell into the egg. Cold eggs are easier to separate than those at room temperature; the yolk breaks less easily.  Fresh eggs are easier to separate than older ones. After cracking the egg, gently pry the shell halves apart. Let the yolk settle into the bottom half of the shell, allowing the white to run over the shell and into a measuring cup or small bowl. Some white will remain with the yolk, so you can gently transfer the yolk back and forth between the shell, continuing to let the white drip over the shell into the bowl.			7	9	9	0	0	0	3	0.0

That gentle folding is key since you want to keep as many of the tiny air bubbles trapped in the beaten whites as you can. The more you mix, and the more vigorously you do it, the more air bubbles you'll lose. Once in the oven, those air bubbles will expand as gases and steam inflate them.			3	2	Two facts. The first fact is that gentle folding is important in order to keep air bubbles trapped in beaten egg whites. The second fact is that these air bubbles will expand in the oven due to gases and steam.	2	0	0	0	0.0
