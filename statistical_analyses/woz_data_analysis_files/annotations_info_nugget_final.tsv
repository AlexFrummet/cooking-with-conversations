-NGusXPorNbKoO2IAC6F	Glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie.  Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.	cegcgsG	55-64	female	active	3	3	3	45 or older

Scottish frying techniques and West African seasoning techniques were combined by enslaved Africans and African-Americans in the American South. Interestingly, the Roman cookbook of ""Apicius"" (4th century) has a recipe for deep-fried chicken called ""Pullum Frontonianum"".

-NH4UhaP7Hk9AOoc-mhQ	This process is called brining.  As the meat sits, the saltwater will slowly dissolve key muscle proteins—most notably myosin, a protein that acts as a sort of glue, holding muscle fibers together.   An overnight brine will penetrate a few millimeters into the meat, giving you built-in seasoning before you ever get to the breading.  Brines also improve juiciness by increasing the muscles' ability to retain moisture. In this case, however, a much, much longer brining time was necessary in order to completely mitigate the effects of high-temperature frying, delivering a uniquely smooth, juicy texture to the meat.

-NH9xlGpmsRScWAiE9Dt	Wow, seems that you're already an expert :-) You're right:  First, the ability of the meat to hold onto moisture increases.  Breading will help mitigate this effect to a degree by slowing down the transfer of energy to the meat, but a significant amount of squeezing is still going to occur regardless of how well breaded the chicken is. Myosin is one of the key proteins responsible for this squeezing action, so by dissolving it, you prevent a lot of moisture loss from taking place.	ABFwuoU	45-54	female	active	2	2	2	45 or older

-NJis7DFF-M_LBglXT6F	"Pesto  or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together.  During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was ""agliata"", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book ""La Cuciniera Genovese"" in 1863"	sVzhG	45-54	female	passive	3	5	5	45 or older

This comparison will vary, depending on factors including, for example, how much food is being cooked at once or if airflow is being restricted, for example by an oversized baking tray. This difference in cooking temperature is offset as the circulating air transfers heat more quickly than still air of the same temperature. In order to transfer the same amount of heat in the same time, the temperature must be lowered to reduce the rate of heat transfer in order to compensate.	rfAHhxd	65-74	male	active	3	4	Four facts.	younger than 45

That's what causes a soufflé to rise, and really, there's no stopping it—your beaten whites will contain air bubbles and those air bubbles will expand, and when they do your soufflé will push higher and higher in its baking dish.	tLrorpH	55-64	female	active	3	3	3	45 or older

-NKIDHOULwMFx5c5Hheq	Wow! That is correct! Duck handles high heat so well for two reasons.  First, the meat all over is on the darker side, giving it a richer, oilier texture that can better withstand the drying effects of high temperatures.

But the soufflé is also more likely to remain runny in the center, since it'd come close to burning on the outside if you were to leave it long enough to cook through to the center.  If you use a lower oven temperature, like 350°F or 375°F, you'll get slightly less of a rise, and the soufflé will brown on the outside more slowly.  That buys you time to leave the soufflé in the oven longer, letting it cook through more fully to the center with less risk that the surface blackens in the process.	tLrorpH	55-64	female	active	2	4	There are four facts in this text.	45 or older

If not, they can be used for other purposes, such as ""giblet pie"" or, a Southern U.S. favorite, giblet gravy. With the exception of giblet gravy, the liver is not usually included in these recipes, as its strong flavor tends to overpower other ingredients.

Knowing that gluten—the network of proteins formed when flour meets water—is the most likely culprit, you can minimize its formation.  First and foremost: cut the protein-rich wheat flour with cornstarch, a pure starch that adds moisture-absorbing capabilities to the breading without adding excess protein.  Replacing a quarter of the flour worked well. Adding a couple teaspoons of baking powder to the mix helped bring a bit of air to the mix, forming a crust that was lighter and crisper, with increased surface area (and we all know that more surface area = more crispness, right?).

-NGvqY1rho1N0jEtgHLG	The Maillard reaction is a non-enzymatic reaction. This reaction is responsible for the production of the flavor when foods are cooked. Examples of foods that undergo Maillard reaction include breads, steaks, and potatoes. It is a chemical reaction that takes place between the amine group of a free amino acid and the carbonyl group of a reducing sugar, usually with the addition of heat. The sugar interacts with the amino acid, producing a variety of odors and flavors. The Maillard reaction is the basis for producing artificial flavors for processed foods in the flavoring industry, since the type of amino acid involved determines the resulting flavor.	tLrorpH	55-64	female	active	3	6	6	45 or older

In this recipe the amount of flour in the béchamel is leaning toward the high end of what's generally called for.

This is significantly cooler than the goal temperature for most fruit pie fillings, which are typically brought to a full boil, but it keeps the apples tender rather than mushy and avoids the problem of a watery pie. When brought to a boil, apples break down and release their juices completely, flooding the pie. A slightly-cooler-than-standard target temperature keeps the apples plump and juicy, with enough structure to retain their own water content, so there isn't as much need for starch.

It is made with egg yolks and beaten egg whites combined with various other ingredients and served as a savory main dish or sweetened as a dessert. The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb ""souffler"" which means ""to blow"", ""to breathe"", ""to inflate"" or ""to puff"". The earliest mention of the soufflé is attributed to French master cook  Vincent La Chapelle, in the early eighteenth century.

-NHA5vKchainYWoMJhym	Ok. So breast meat is composed mainly of what are known as fast-twitch muscles—muscles that are rarely used on a day-to-day basis, but are great for quick, powerful bursts of action. Fast-twitch muscle tends to be relatively light in color and low in connective tissue and fat. Leg meat, on the other hand, is mainly slow-twitch muscle. It's used day in and day out as the turkey walks around scratching for food. As a result, it's darker and packed with tough connective tissue. Because the two muscle structures are so massively different, they must be cooked differently to achieve ideal results. Breast meat is best when cooked to no higher than about 150°F-any higher and it dries out. On the other hand, the tough connective tissue in leg meat doesn't get tender until it gets to at least 165°F (74°C) or so.	ABFwuoU	45-54	female	active	3	6	6	45 or older

When mashing up seeds and leaves into powders, rounded and smooth ground stones would be used inside a stone bowl. This pair of tools is called a mortar and pestle.

-NKgvqbKOL4dDhnG2Ped	I have to say, there's no single best way to separate an egg. First, though, a few tips: Make sure your hands are scrupulously clean. No matter how you separate your eggs, the yolks and whites are likely to come into contact with your fingers. You don't want to transfer anything germy from your hands to the eggs. No matter what method you use, start by gently cracking the egg against a flat surface, so that you don't get eggshell into the egg. Cold eggs are easier to separate than those at room temperature; the yolk breaks less easily.  Fresh eggs are easier to separate than older ones. After cracking the egg, gently pry the shell halves apart. Let the yolk settle into the bottom half of the shell, allowing the white to run over the shell and into a measuring cup or small bowl. Some white will remain with the yolk, so you can gently transfer the yolk back and forth between the shell, continuing to let the white drip over the shell into the bowl.	7460a2a0	45-54	male	passive	7	9	9	45 or older

By doing this, the chicken comes out just as moist as with water brine, and it is significantly more tender as well, due to the tenderizing effects of buttermilk on food (soaking it for more than one night led to chicken that was so tender that it bordered on mush).

Unlike a chicken, which has delicate white meat that reaches kindling-level dryness north of 155°F, and beef, which is loaded with loins that turn to jerky at high heat, duck is one of those special creatures whose every part is just as delicious served well-done as pink.

-NKdCzlTnUqReo3uhVmr	Well that's fine!  With most Western breads and pastries, cold or room temperature liquid is added to flour before kneading it.  A ball of well-kneaded cold water dough will spring back if you press it and contract if you stretch it. This is why, for example, pizza dough is extremely hard to roll out until it's had at least a couple hours to rest and allow this gluten to relax.	c70f521	45-54	female	active	3	3	3	45 or older

-NKIEVCBYc8M9GJsx7O5	Before proceeding to the next step, let me give you a tip on how to make this sauce.  A much, much better approach is to use the wet technique for making a caramel.  You basically add water to the sugar first, which wets and dissolves it, speeding up the caramelization process while helping to prevent scorching.  The water cooks off as the mixture boils and it's clear to the eye when the caramel reaches a nice deep amber color.	1vNO49Y	35-44	male	active	1	3	3	younger than 45

-NGvpAYacZ7dKMHLYiBS	"First, the heat of the oven is a critical ""ingredient"" for getting a soufflé to rise; it's what causes gases to expand inside all those trapped air bubbles and what converts moisture in the soufflé batter to steam. Together, those forces expand the air bubbles and cause the soufflé to swell. The hotter the oven, the more quickly and fully the soufflé will rise, and the faster it will brown and set on the outside. The heat also sets the proteins in the egg yolks and whites, allowing the soufflé to keep some of its height even after cooling. Without the eggs setting, the soufflé batter would remain liquid and would immediately collapse back down to its original state as soon as it cooled. Lastly, the heat browns the surface of the soufflé, giving it a deeper flavor, thanks to our good friend the Maillard reaction."	tLrorpH	55-64	female	active	7	4	There are 4 facts in the text.	45 or older
-NGqBwsiGNdvuvJghYgd	A hot water dough, on the other hand, works differently. By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough.

So if you use a ceramic mortar with a narrow ceramic pestle, the results are good, but the sauce never fully emulsifies.  The Thai granite mortar and pestle does a much better job, but it still didn't come close to the effectiveness of the Italian marble mortar with the large wooden pestle.  That large pestle head is perfect for efficiently smashing the garlic to paste, and the pine nuts, too. The basil yields under it in a fraction of the time and breaks down more fully.	60c48655811ab33a8f77dd34	18-24	female	passive	3	6	6	younger than 45

-N5tyuP3Xs20PcPaI3s8	So your guess regarding the heat is correct! That's the important thing. In our case, glass is important because it determines the rate at which heat is conducted to the pie. Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy. Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.	5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	18-24	non-binary	active	0	3	There are three facts in this text: 1.

-NBXCfeMr5VQPItnZOp_	So speaking of nuts in pesto:Walnuts are actually a traditional alternative to pine nuts for Pesto alla Genovese; pine nuts have always been scarce, even in early-20th-century Italy.  As a caution, though, you need to get good, fresh walnuts and make sure to get all of the skin off the nuts, or the pesto will taste bitter and rancid.Almonds could also work, although I'd think they'd be rather bland.  The herb pastes which traditionally have crushed almonds -- such as Romanesco sauce -- include some hot pepper.  Again, freshness and getting the skin off is important. As long as you toast them properly first, they are delicious (though not the same as pine nuts, of course -- not nearly as fatty, for one thing).	coe2XtNapn	25-34	female	passive	2	6	6	younger than 45

You can either use an expensive copper egg-beating bowl, which helps form more stable beaten whites that are less prone to breaking and weeping (the copper interferes with too-strong sulfur bonds from forming). You can add a little cream of tartar to the whites, an acid that also prevents those sulfur bonds from forming.	rEG2v4CE7m	35-44	male	active	0	2	2	younger than 45

The most important thing you need to do in terms of carving happens before the duck even goes in the oven—removing the wishbone. As I mentioned in the primer for dry-aging ducks, I like to remove the wishbone after the birds have finished aging in the fridge. The skin and flesh around the neck cavity dry out during the aging process, making it easier to locate and cut out the wishbone cleanly, without taking a chunk of breast meat with it. Once the crown is roasted and rested, carving the breasts off the cage is pretty simple. Use a sharp knife, preferably a slicer with a long thin blade that allows you to cut with smooth even strokes. Slice into the breast on one side of the breastbone and use steady, smooth knife strokes, riding the contour of the breastbone with the blade and gently pulling the breast back with your off-hand as you cut. The breast will gradually pull away from the cage, and you can cut it away completely at the point where it connects with the shoulder joint. Remove the second breast and then set aside the crown carcass for making another batch of duck stock. Take a second to trim up the breasts before slicing and serving. The bottom edge of the breast where it protruded from the crown has very little meat along with some tough cartilage and skin. Place the breasts skin-side-down on your board, trim off those pieces, and discard them. On the upper edge of the breast, you will find a large pocket of fat between the meat and skin. I like to trim that away as well. Now you get to pick your preferred slicing presentation for serving. You can slice the breasts crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick pieces that are ideal for a family-style meal or in half, lengthwise, if you're going for more of a minimalist fine-dining vibe.	612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	55-64	female	active	7	14	14	45 or older

Pinch to seal both crusts together and trim to 3/4 inch.

-N6Jo-3BrjsTvep78TUB	"Pesto or to refer to the original dish pesto alla genovese , is a sauce originating in Genoa, the capital city of Liguria, Italy.  Pesto is thought to have two predecessors in ancient times, going back as far as the Roman age. The ancient Romans used to eat a similar paste called moretum, which was made by crushing garlic, salt, cheese, herbs, olive oil and vinegar together. The use of this paste in the Roman cuisine is mentioned in the ""Appendix Vergiliana"", an ancient collection of poems where the author dwells on the details about the preparation of ""moretum"". During the Middle Ages, a popular sauce in the Genoan cuisine was ""agliata"", which was basically a mash of garlic and walnuts, as garlic was a staple in the nutrition of Ligurians, especially for the seafarers. The introduction of basil, the main ingredient of modern pesto, occurred in more recent times and is first documented only in the mid-19th century, when gastronomist Giovanni Battista Ratto published his book ""La Cuciniera Genovese"" in 1863:"	5ea196f089935b04d2ee69d9	45-54	female	active	2	5	There are 5 facts in this text.	45 or older

-NBWwj3B2wfvOslLL-w9	By adding flour directly to boiling water, you actually end up not only denaturing the proteins, but smashing them into small pieces. Some degree of gluten can still form, but because cooked proteins aren't nearly as stretchy or clingy as raw ones, you won't get anywhere near the elasticity of a cold-water dough. Adding butter and other fats to the dough will further diminish its gluten-forming abilities. If we were to try and make gnocchi with a cold water dough, one with plenty of springy, elastic gluten, we'd have a heck of a time getting those gnocchi hot enough to expand to the point where they come out nice and airy; Instead, we'd end up with dense, chewy nubs that taste more like damp bread.

-NBRrYspACgu2T29B_Ok	Basil is sensitive to cold, with best growth in hot, dry conditions. It behaves as an annual if there is any chance of a frost. However, due to its popularity, basil is cultivated in many countries around the world. Production areas include countries in the Mediterranean area, those in the temperate zone, and others in subtropical climates. Although basil grows best outdoors, it can be grown indoors in a pot and, like most herbs, will do best on a sun-facing windowsill. It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or row cover is ideal if available. It can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.	8nJXjVjBTQ	18-24	female	active	3	8	There are eight facts in this text.	younger than 45

-N5k0q8LrHdd2k1NwoMO	Yes precisely!  To do it, you add water to the sugar first, which wets and dissolves it, speeding up the caramelization process while helping to prevent scorching. The water cooks off as the mixture boils (which, incidentally, you can swirl and stir and otherwise monkey with to ensure even browning, no wet pastry brush needed), and it's clear to the eye when the caramel reaches a nice deep amber color. At this point, you can add the vinegar in very small additions, gently swirling as you do; it will boil and bubble violently, so take your time to avoid a boil-over. Some of the sugar might seize up a bit, but if you keep swirling, it'll dissolve back into the solution quickly.	612517df29cd32c6632b4a44	55-64	female	active	3	3	There are 3 facts in this text: 1) Adding water to sugar speeds up the caramelization process and prevents scorching     2) The water cooks off as the mixture boils and the caramel turns amber in color     3) Vinegar can be added in small additions, causing boiling and bubbling, and some sugar may seize up but will dissolve back into the solution if stirred.	45 or older

-NBMF8vcfIrDLphxKlMD	Buttermilk is a fermented dairy drink. Traditionally, it was the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. However, most modern buttermilk is cultured. It is common in warm climates (including the Balkans, South Asia, the Middle East and the Southern United States) where unrefrigerated fresh milk sours quickly. Buttermilk can be drunk straight, and it can also be used in cooking. In making Soda bread, the acid in buttermilk reacts with the raising agent, sodium bicarbonate, to produce carbon dioxide which acts as the leavening agent. Buttermilk is also used in marination, especially of chicken and pork, which the lactic acid helps to tenderize, retain moisture and allows added flavors to permeate the meat.	o9UbVjHVrS	25-34	female	active	7	7	7	younger than 45

( The mixture weighs little more than the brown sugar added in step one.) This is more or less the same thing that happens with my fresh lemon syrup, in which dry lemon rinds are tossed with seven ounces of sugar to yield a scant eight ounces of syrup after a few hours. That lack of moisture means there's no need to spend time and energy cooking the liquid down to concentrate the ""juices,"" as the liquid is already quite concentrated in terms of both flavor and water content. Further cooking will only candy the syrup and bring out the funky flavors of caramelized fructose, while the overall water content of the fruit is easily managed through a touch of tapioca starch."	5ed91d3f31d9c60a8ac27018	18-24	non-binary	active	2	3	3	younger than 45

-NBMGX5eVgptJN3zbwON	Buttermilk is the byproduct of butter making.Butter is made by agitating cream resulting in clumps of fat and a milky white liquid that contains nearly no fat and some protein. If the cream was soured before (either by aging or by inoculating the cream with lactobacillae), the buttermilk will also be sour. If the butter was made from unfermented cream, the buttermilk will be mild.Uncultured buttermilk is rarely sold, even if butter is made commercially with regular cream, the resulting buttermilk is soured afterwards.As buttermilk is made from a fraction of whole milk (the cream), you could say it’s a part of soured milk. I outlined the process of butter making in this answer, that should also help understanding buttermilk.	o9UbVjHVrS	25-34	female	active	7	8	8	younger than 45

At first, this can actually be an advantage. Less hydrophobic molecules in your oil means that it can come into closer contact with foods, allowing them to fry just a bit more efficiently. However,   as this breakdown continues, your oil becomes less and less hydrophobic, and eventually it'll start entering your food too rapidly, causing it to turn greasy and ruining its crispness.

About 20 species of pine produce seeds large enough to be worth harvesting; in other pines, the seeds are also edible, but are too small to be of notable value as a human food. Throughout Europe and Middle East the pine nuts used are traditionally from ""Pinus pinea"" (stone pine). They are easily distinguished from the Asian pine nuts by their more slender shape and more homogeneous flesh. Because of the lower price, Asian pine nuts are also often used, especially in cheaper preparations.

But the soufflé is also more likely to remain runny in the center, since it'd come close to burning on the outside if you were to leave it long enough to cook through to the center. If you like a fully set soufflé, a lower temperature might be your preference.	rEG2v4CE7m	35-44	male	active	3	3	3	younger than 45

It is, on occasion, served with whipped cream or iced cream (which is known as ""apple pie a la mode""), or with cheddar cheese. The pastry part is generally used top-and-bottom, making it a ""double-crust pie""; the upper crust may be circular or latticed (woven of crosswise strips). Depending on the baker's preference, the bottom crust may be baked first (before baking the whole pie) to prevent it from getting soggy."	608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	35-44	male	passive	3	4	4	younger than 45

-NBg2RTAF0LkPhaJ8OSw	So Parisian gnocchi are somewhat of an oddity in the Western repertoire, in that they're made with a hot water dough.  The beauty of a hot water dough is that it doesn't bounce back as much as a cold water dough does.  As a result, a pâte à choux dough isn't stretchy or bouncy; its more malleable and supple, kind of like Play-Do. With our tender, easy-to-shape hot water dough, however, the stretching is easy, and, what's more, the gnocchi keep their stretched-out shape even after they begin to cool, ensuring that they stay light and tender no matter how we choose to finish them off.	h8x8QLzyCx	25-34	female	passive	3	3	Three.	younger than 45

-NBWzn2wHtQHEWBeebQD	It is a flat, rectangular metal pan used in an oven. It is often used for baking bread rolls, pastries and flat products such as cookies, sheet cakes, Swiss rolls and pizzas. Typically, for rimmed trays, each rim will sacrifice 0.5–0.75 inches (1–2 cm) of baking surface along that edge. Pans of a single design from a single vendor will usually share the same rim height and rake across all tray sizes in a series, thus the sacrifice of flat baking surface is proportionally greater (relative to outer dimension) for small pans than for large pans.

Used in cooking and not at the table, it consists mainly of sodium chloride and may include anticaking agents. Because the salt has a purer flavor due to the lack of metallic or bitter-tasting additives such as iodine, fluoride or dextrose, it is often used in the kitchen instead of additive-containing table salt, so such flavors are not introduced to prepared food.	eiRY3df7Aq	35-44	male	active	3	4	4	younger than 45

Heavy materials, like thick ceramic or stoneware, will slow that process down, which can produce a dense and greasy crust. Meanwhile, lightweight metal, like aluminum, may speed things up so much that by the time the crust is golden brown, the apples may still be a little crunchy.  Glass lands right in the middle, conducting heat at a brisk but not breakneck pace, so that the crust turns out flaky and crisp just as the apples cook through.	608b0f7f4699c09aa348c57f	35-44	male	passive	2	3	3	younger than 45

Stand the chicken on its neck, legs point to the ceiling and breasts pointing away from you. slide the cleaver between the body and wing, cutting through the joint close to the body.  You should slide the knife between the joint cutting only the tendons, not the bone.Remove the legs.  lie the chicken on its back one leg near you, one leg away from you.  slide the knife between the joint near the body, again cutting only tendon not bone and remove the leg.Separate the thigh from the drumstick, again go for the joint.  If you want the legs to be in smaller pieces then you can cut each thigh and drumstick in two with a firm action.  You have 2 choices for techniqueStart with the cleaver tip furthest from you on the board, place the thigh under the blade and push down firmly and quickly.  you should cut through the bone.Chop through the bone by lifting the cleaver in the air and bringing down hard and fast.  This has better chance of a cleaner cut through the bone, but you need to be a better aim. Split the carcass in half.  Stand in the same position as 1. and with the blade parallel to to your body cut down through the carcass so you have the back and the breast in separate piecesRemove the breast from the bone by sliding the knife (might want to use a smaller knife here) between the meat and the bone.  Remove the backbone out of the back, kitchen scissors are easiest.  you can skip this if the back doesn't have much meat.Cut the back pieces into nice size pieces across the length.Slice the breast pieces crosswise into nice size piecesReassemble the chicken on the plate with the breast meat on top of the back pieces	5e45a7e926e79c000bc12a85	25-34	female	active	7	7	7	younger than 45
